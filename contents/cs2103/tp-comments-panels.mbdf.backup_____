Currently since we are using UUID.randomUUID(), the edge case that could potentially happen is a null UUID rather than that of a UUID that is not specified properly, unless the user decides to edit the uuid in the json file to a smaller uuid string.

I know this is a bit late, but do you think we should change `AddPersonCommand` to `AddPatientCommand`?

I think our `Person` refers specifically to `Patient` since we have the `periodOfStay` field. If we are adding a `Staff` class in the future, it may be a little misleading since `Staff` is a `Person` too.

Do you think an Enum may be preferable here since there are a limited number of possible values?

Using 'int' is not very scalable. If we have 10 different search conditions, we would need 10 'int', and it can be hard to keep track of these variables.

Perhaps we can declare a nested Enum:

'''
private enum SearchCondition {
    SEARCH_BY_NAME.
    SEARCH_BY_TEMPERATURE,
    SEARCH_CONDITION_INVALID; // no condition or multiple conditions given
}
'''

If you would like to use 'int', maybe it would be better to make them static and change the variable names to indicate they are constants. E.g.

'''
private static final int SEARCH_BY_NAME = 1;
'''

Personally, I think Enum might be neater. 😄

Perhaps we could name this `AddRoomCommand` instead?

It is less about whether the user will enter a negative number, and more about how we should secure our application.

Personally, I feel that it is good if we can handle as many exceptional cases (sometimes called edge cases) as possible. Without proper handling, anyone can crash the app simply by entering a negative number. It can be annoying for the user if they accidentally type in a negative number and the app just stops working.

Besides, near the end of the semester, our application will be manually tested for bugs. I am fairly sure the testers will try to use negative numbers as inputs. If they can cause the application to crash, they will flag the problem as a bug and deduct our marks for it. Let's do our best to stop that from happening! 😄

Would it not be possible to use an `ArrayList<Room>`?

I think it is easier to understand if you iterate through all the `Room` objects in a loop and call an `isEmpty()` method to determine which `Room` is empty.

Performance-wise, I understand `PriorityQueue` may be better but we are sacrificing code clarity for performance.

since you are only counting the number of occupied rooms directly, will there be a problem with this? eg.
i have 3 rooms
* room 1
* room 2
* room 3

So lets say ``room 1`` and ``room 3`` are occupied. so ``numberOfRoomsOccupied = 2`` correct? But next time if you load the ``RoomBook``, it will give me ``room 1`` and ``room 2`` occupied since the ``numberOfRoomsOccupied`` is 2?

Hmm... I think putting it at the top would be more convenient for users to just take a quick look... But the word 'summary' makes it feel like we concluding something so its weird for it to be at the top... Why not change the heading to like 'Command List' or something equivalent?

Actually you can remove the isPersonFound attribute totally. if (personName.equals(nameToSearch) can just return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SEARCH_PERSON_SUCCESS, personFound)) directly. If the execution of code proceeds beyond this for loop, can just throw new CommandException outside. Just a suggestion to keep your code shorter :)

Will be good to include a MESSAGE_SUCCESS attribute or something similar for the string " rooms are added in a hotel" (can refer to the other command classes to see what I mean). 
E.g. in addPatientCommand your have the attribute String MESSAGE_SUCCESS = "New person added: %1$s";
So what you return is return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, numPersonToAdd)) instead of the hardcoded string.

This attribute was what I was referring to for MESSAGE_USAGE earlier. Perhaps you may need to shift this attribute to AddNumberOfRoomsCommand class instead to keep it consistent with the formatting of other command classes.

Ok actually I am kind of confused of the flow and purpose of the addNumberOfRooms command. I thought for first time user we will get them to initialise the number of rooms and that will be fixed through out the usage of the app. So addNumberOfRooms in this case should be for initialisation? It doesn't make sense if halfway throughout the usage of the app I suddenly call addNumberOfRooms command again unless I built more rooms for my facility. :/

I'm not sure if `<ins>` is the correct tag to use here? (And the closing tag should be `</ins>` right) From what I gathered online `<ins>` is to underline some text in html to indicate it is an insertion, but there's not `<del>` tag here, so I think it might be more appropriate to use either the `<u>` tag for underlining or `[]()` syntax if its supposed to be a link

I assume we're using Person's Name and Phone classes for now since they help guarantee certain text properties. We'll probably have to change this in the future (at least the naming, for example wage being a Phone object seems odd)? Perhaps using String for now may keep things even simpler, but I suppose this works for now!

Perhaps we could name this `InternshipStatus` or something along those lines instead? Do let me know if I'm mistaken, but it seems that we have a Job class that has the variables - jobTitle, companyName and industry. So this status object should be reflective of an Internship status rather than a Job status? Shall we ensure that "Job" and "Internship" are not interchangeable terms throughout our code base? Another issue that might still arise even after changing the name to `InternshipStatus` is that we will then have a `Status` and `InternshipStatus` class, and it may not be obvious what the difference is between the 2 in terms of their names? Would it be possible/better to make this a private enum within the Status class?

As we'll also need to add Jobs in a company object, this `Job` object seems to differ implementation-wise from the `Job` object that we may use for company objects, though they should probably be the same? For example, in a `Company` object, during its creation via a user command, the user can input multiple industries and jobs that a company has. This creates the `Company` object, along with its multiple jobs and industries. So in those `Job` objects in the `Company` object, will each of them have multiple industries tagged to them instead of just one industry as in this `Job` object? Also, since a `Company` stores `Job` objects, would this create a cyclical dependency if we change the `Name companyName` part to `Company company` in the future (I assume we will)? At this juncture, it seems that if `Job` is going to store Company and Industry, perhaps we may not even need `Job` objects? Perhaps we could simply use String (or Name) for jobs? This may also help to synchronize with how jobs will have to be represented in a `Company` object.

I think the `Status` and `ApplicationStatus` names suggested work, but perhaps sticking to `InternshipStatus` might still be better so we don't introduce more terms for the same object (for e.g. application and internship both refer to internship applications)? So maybe swapping the current `Status` and `InternshipStatus` names will do? May have to consult the rest haha, just some suggestions!

> Hmm. The dilemma now is that this is just a proof of concept and we may be abstracting common logic down the line and scrapping all these, so overwriting Javadocs now may redundant. The danger is that if the code is kept and the comments are missed in the future. What is the team's opinion on this? @ZoroarkDarkrai @keanecjy @seanjyjy @shawn-nyk

I agree that overwriting Javadocs now may be redundant, especially because our code can change over time up until the final version. At the same time, I also agree that we may miss them in the future, and doing a one-time run-through of all our code at the end may be very tedious and error-prone. As such, how about we do something like: every time we create new bits of code that require Javadocs, or we modify code that already has Javadocs attached to them, we place a standardized comment, such as `TODO: Javadocs` above the code we need to write/edit Javadocs for? That way we get the syntax highlighting that IntelliJ provides for the `TODO` keyword, and we can also search for this standardised comment throughout the code base to hone in on where we'll eventually need to write/edit Javadocs when the time comes. Any thoughts on this?

Could add constructor tests eg: Referencing from person/AddressTest, as constructor has requireAllNonNull similar to person.Address
This could be applied to a lot of previously seen files.
Something like this is possible:
'''suggestion
    
    @Test
    public void constructor_null_throwsNullPointerException() {
        assertThrows(NullPointerException.class, () -> new Location(null));
    }
    
    @Test
    public void constructor_invalidAddress_throwsIllegalArgumentException() {
        String invalidLocation = "";
        assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> new Location(invalidLocation));
    }
    /**
'''

Would be good if you can include the `toString()` methods for the Answer and Question class, that way when it is implemented in the GUI it would be easier to render it seperately (since the current way to access the string form of the question and answer is through the Flashcard class). 

The current `toString()` method in FlashCard is still useful when interacting with the application through CLI 👍

Looks good! Just wondering whether it would be better if we made userAnswer an Answer type also, that way we can potentially do more things with it in the future. 

If userAnswer was an Answer type, we can just override `.equals()` as a way of comparison to check if userAnswer is indeed Answer.

## Issues
### Format
When creating an issue, try to specify the part of the project the issue is meant to be working on by using square brackets in the title. If the issue does not specify anything, it is assumed to be implementation-based, i.e., related to modifying AB3/VirusTracker code. 

Example: `[DG] Add UC01 and UC02` indicates that this issue works on adding user cases 01 and 02 to the developer guide.

### Labeling
**Mandatory label**:
 * `priority.*` Indicates the priority level of the task. Has three levels, low, medium and high.

Apart from the mandatory priority label, you may include other labels to make it easier to search and locate issues. Feel free to add any labels, but please _**ensure no similar label already exists**_.

## Pull Requests

General note: PRs can only be merged only when two or more other people have reviewed and approved of the merge.

### Format for PR 
When creating the PR, please state which issues the PR closes on the last line of the description.

**Commit message:** 'keyword #xx, keyword #yy, keyword #zz' for multiple issues
* 'keyword' refers to any one of the following three words, 'close', 'fix', 'resolve'.
   * Using these keywords will cause the issue to be automatically closed once the PR is merged successfully.
   * _Note: Other tenses for the above words could be used as well, such as 'closes' or 'closed', but let us standardise using the 
     imperative form of the words above._
* '#xx' references the issue number, where xx is the number. For example, xx = 10 will reference issue number 10.

 Example: xx = 30
'''
...PR description here

Close #xx
''' 
The above will close issue 30 upon the successful merging of the PR. 
_The actual form of #xx is not used in this comment as it would reference actual issues. Please refer to the PRs page for more examples._

Looks like you're using the assertion incorrectly, it should be
`assert amount >= 0 : "amount cannot be negative";` instead.

Currently it will print the error message regardless of whether the assertion passed or failed.

Also a side note: we should use the java `logger` instead of `System.out.println` apparently.

Nope, if you try to declare multiple of the same parameters there will be an assertion error somewhere.

Technically you can work around this, by declaring a new class that contains the two parameters, e.g.
the command:
'takeTwoIntegers 1 2'
may have a parameter
'private Parameter<IntPair> param = this.addParameter(..., IntPair::parse)'

and the IntPair class is as follows:
'''java
class IntPair {
  public int a;
  public int b;
  public parse(String str) {
    IntPair result = new IntPair();
    result.a = ...
  }
'''

Don't think any of our commands will involve these kinds of parameters, but if they do we may have to either redesign the command or the parser. (We'll solve that problem when it happens)

The Timer class is only used to keep track of the active timers. Once the timer is stopped, the data is stored under a WorkDuration class (which has not reference to project), and put in a list inside the corresponding project.

I implemented it this way because I didn't want to store incomplete timers in a project, since it might cause problems if the timer wasn't stopped properly. Its also easier to check for active timers this way (see activeTimer in ModelManager)

And i think it would be easier to extend to having multiple concurrent timers if we decide to do that (then each timer needs to know which project its keeping track of)

Just storing the index won't work because the filtered list might change while the timer is running.

This is mostly what i was referring to when i said more/better tests are needed.

Basically, since I'm using LocalDateTime.now() to get the current time, 2 times will never be exactly the same (they will be some nanoseconds apart). For example in tests, even if I start 2 timers immediately after one another, they will have different values, so equals() will still say that they're different. Since the existing tests involve checking if 2 models are equal, this will break a bunch of existing tests.

I'm think of either (a) Overloading the timer functions so that I can start them at a fixed time (just for testing) or (b) Introduce a custom global clock for the application to run on. The global clock will be the same as system clock in production, but in testing it will have functions that allow us to manually control the time.

A user will never see this message (as of now) since we don't require users to manually input times. If we add commands that involve time inputs, then it might be better to not use ISO8601 format in the first place (its hard to read) and instead use some variation of the "yyyy MM dd hh:mm:ss" style.

Hmm. The dilemma now is that this is just a proof of concept and we may be abstracting common logic down the line and scrapping all these, so overwriting Javadocs now may redundant. The danger is that if the code is kept and the comments are missed in the future. What is the team's opinion on this? @ZoroarkDarkrai @keanecjy @seanjyjy @shawn-nyk

> Yup I think that there isn't a need to concern about javadocs / comments as of now as they can be easily fixed at any point in time. @orzymandias I stopped editing the List portions as I noticed that there were too much code duplication with your pr. Do we plan to either extend an `Item` class or use generics for our list?

I agree. I think there is unnecessary duplication for collections, generics is a good idea for collections but one issue is with throwing custom exceptions for different types of items within the generic list. Should we just have DuplicateItemException then something like `throw new DuplicateItemException(T.getDuplicateExceptionMsg())`?

> I don't think this works because we are not able to access methods in java generics. I figured since we all are classifying our classes as `Item`, we can have an `Item` interface to contain all the methods similar methods like `isSameItem` and likewise do `throw new DuplicateItemException(item.getItemName())`?

Sounds good.

I've been meaning to consult the team prior to seeing your comment. The links you provided were really helpful to the resolution of the test errors I encountered. Alternatively, I have updated the settings in my IntelliJ to resolve the issue. You can check out the following link for the alternative strategy I employed.

I think what Shawn said makes sense. It might be better to stick to terms that are already established eg `InternshipStatus`. If I am not wrong does the `status` class exist only for `Internship`? If that is the case, maybe you can consider shifting `date` to the `Internship` object instead and as such, there won't be any ambiguity in the naming.

> > Hmm. The dilemma now is that this is just a proof of concept and we may be abstracting common logic down the line and scrapping all these, so overwriting Javadocs now may redundant. The danger is that if the code is kept and the comments are missed in the future. What is the team's opinion on this? @ZoroarkDarkrai @keanecjy @seanjyjy @shawn-nyk
> 
> I agree that overwriting Javadocs now may be redundant, especially because our code can change over time up until the final version. At the same time, I also agree that we may miss them in the future, and doing a one-time run-through of all our code at the end may be very tedious and error-prone. As such, how about we do something like: every time we create new bits of code that require Javadocs, or we modify code that already has Javadocs attached to them, we place a standardized comment, such as `TODO: Javadocs` above the code we need to write/edit Javadocs for? That way we get the syntax highlighting that IntelliJ provides for the `TODO` keyword, and we can also search for this standardised comment throughout the code base to hone in on where we'll eventually need to write/edit Javadocs when the time comes. Any thoughts on this?

I think this is a great idea what do the rest think?

yes, it is designed to modify its input arguments. this wouldn't be necessary if java had some semblance of decent features after 14 versions, like pattern matching;

this is how i use bisect in a proper language:
'''cpp
std::string_view x;
std::string_view xs;

std::tie(x, xs) = util::bisect(input, ' ');
if(x.empty()) return { };

if(x[0] == '@')
{
	parse_tags(msg, x);
	std::tie(x, xs) = util::bisect(xs, ' ');
}

if(x[0] == ':')
{
	parse_prefix(msg, x);
	std::tie(x, xs) = util::bisect(xs, ' ');
}
'''

unfortunately this can't be done in java (there's no 'std::tie' equivalent, nor can there ever be). rather than introduce loads of syntactic noise by needing to (a) declare a pair to store the bisectionr result; (b) declare or assign a variable for the first part; (c) declare or assign a variable for the second part, it is more convenient this way.

besides, 'bisect()' clearly documents its mutating behaviour.

Why will there be an error message after the tag is created (Line 326-328)? Maybe you can write it this way(?):
MSS
1. User requests to add a tag.
2. Projact adds a tag.
Use case ends.

Extensions
2a. The tag already exists.
2a1. Projact shows an error message.
Use case ends.

Is this clearer haha and also must we show in the use case that there are 2 ways to add a tag (like in user guide) or a general one (seen above) is ok?

Yes, I did thought of this while I was writing the code for this Job class. Yes, I think that we may need need a Job object and it can be represented as a `String` instead. Will edit the code accordingly. Great catch on this!

Yes haha, I had a good laugh earlier when I represented wage as a Phone object. Reason I did so was to use AB3's current implementation of the `Name` object (which is basically a class with a string containing only AlphaNumeric characters) and `Phone` object (which is essentially a class with a string containing only Numeric characters). I think that we can rename it in the near future and make use of them in all our classes. What do you think?

Yup, I think its best if we could ensure that the "Job" and "Internship" names are not used loosely throughout the code base. I don't particularly like the idea of a nested class, since I do intend to use the enum outside of this Status class (for parsing and input). Also, would it better to rename the `Status` class as `ApplicationStatus` and the enum to be called `Status` instead?

Thanks for the input. I created a Status class to abstract out the application status and date details from the internship. But perhaps now that I think about it simply renaming the fields to `InternshipStatus` and `StatusDate` would do. Let me know if this arrangement is fine.

Yup I think that there isn't a need to concern about javadocs / comments as of now as they can be easily fixed at any point in time. @orzymandias I stopped editing the List portions as I noticed that there were too much code duplication with your pr. Do we plan to either extend an `Item` class or use generics for our list?

> ecessary duplication for collections, generics is a good idea for collections but one issue is with throwing custom exceptions for different types of items within the generic list. Should we just have DuplicateItemException then something like `throw new DuplicateItemException(T.getDuplicateExceptionMsg())`?

I don't think this works because we are not able to access methods in java generics. I figured since we all are classifying our classes as `Item`, we can have an `Item` interface to contain all the methods similar methods like `isSameItem` and likewise do `throw new DuplicateItemException(item.getItemName())`?

I think instead of writing in a point form, it could be written in full sentences. The language used here also feels informal and incomplete.
Some examples could be:
- More convenient than typical apps as lessons and assignments are managed in just one app so there is no need to switch between different ones.
- Easier to manage schedule than typical scheduling apps as assignments are automatically scheduled.

> For the Leader Object, you want to make it an instance of a Person? Such that it can contain email, address etc. I have included that in my implementation of Teammate. Lemme change that to Person then maybe your Leader can be an instance of Person too. This way you dun have to create email classes etc for the Leader

Maybe we want to wait for Lucas to implement the association class and make Leader class a subclass of association?

I did attempt to place the EPIC within each section, but github markdown does not allow you to create merged cells. So the sentence is wrapped within the a small single cell. I would suggest, if we want to include the epics, to create a separate table and reference the [EPICS] accordingly.

The extension is specific to step 2 of the MSS ("TBM shows a list of clients that match user's query"), hence the extension should be named `2a` instead of `1a` isn't it?

edit: yeap, the suggestion by ming chong is correct, I'll change it to what he suggested, ref to this for similar example, the "error" check happens after the actor (user) submits:

`list` is an AB3 command, I didn't add that in actually. Instead, I copied over from our HackMD file what I had to add in.
that's why `person` persisted and wasn't changed to `clients`

Change to a clearer def. Since TBM performs basic contact management/tracking, the use case should be able to handle the scenario when the user inadvertently tries to add a duplicate entry for someone he might already have an entry. (Could be due to previous professional deals, working relations... etc that he forgot.). Duplicate entries would cause the archives to get messy, and so I added the case where TBM prevents/User does not add the duplicate entry.

The new business deal might involve some party which the user has encountered before and thus might have an entry in TBM, but forgot. So I wrote the uc in a vague way to put in the duplicate entry uc. @raysonkoh

Can't pass CI due to checkstyle error in RemarkCommandTest.java.
Checkstyle document says to put "import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test" **after** the "import static seedu" statements, but upon doing that, it says that the "import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test" is **lexicographically before** the "import static seedu" statements, and should be put before them. I don't know how to solve this checkstyle conflict.
