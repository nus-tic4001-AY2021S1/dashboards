Because of the need to include the `CURRENT_INDICATOR` for a particular entry, which is rather specific to `ViewHistoryCommand`, the method in `StringUtil` would be oddly specialised for a method in the `commons` package.

Instead, I think I would abstract out the creation of the message to a helper function that resides within the `ViewHistoryCommand` class.

Separate-line comment with whitespace, singular verb, and uppercase 1st character.

'''

Command command = addressBookParser.parseCommand(commandText);

I know this is a bit late, but do you think we should change `AddPersonCommand` to `AddPatientCommand`?

I think our `Person` refers specifically to `Patient` since we have the `periodOfStay` field. If we are adding a `Staff` class in the future, it may be a little misleading since `Staff` is a `Person` too.

What do you think?

For separate-line comments, do you think we should keep the first character in uppercase?

Do you think an Enum may be preferable here since there are a limited number of possible values?

Using 'int' is not very scalable. If we have 10 different search conditions, we would need 10 'int', and it can be hard to keep track of these variables.

Perhaps we can declare a nested Enum:

'''
private enum SearchCondition {
    SEARCH_BY_NAME.
    SEARCH_BY_TEMPERATURE,
    SEARCH_CONDITION_INVALID; // no condition or multiple conditions given
}
'''

If you would like to use 'int', maybe it would be better to make them static and change the variable names to indicate they are constants. E.g.

'''
private static final int SEARCH_BY_NAME = 1;
'''

Personally, I think Enum might be neater. 😄

It is less about whether the user will enter a negative number, and more about how we should secure our application.

Personally, I feel that it is good if we can handle as many exceptional cases (sometimes called edge cases) as possible. Without proper handling, anyone can crash the app simply by entering a negative number. It can be annoying for the user if they accidentally type in a negative number and the app just stops working.

Besides, near the end of the semester, our application will be manually tested for bugs. I am fairly sure the testers will try to use negative numbers as inputs. If they can cause the application to crash, they will flag the problem as a bug and deduct our marks for it. Let's do our best to stop that from happening! 😄

I think it is easier to understand if you iterate through all the `Room` objects in a loop and call an `isEmpty()` method to determine which `Room` is empty.

Because `isSamePatient(...)` uses name, age, and phone number as criteria to detect duplicate `Patient` in a list, will this not pose a problem when deleting? It is possible to have more than 1 `Patient` with the same name after all. In that case, only the first matching `Patient` is deleted. 

I think it may be a little strange that the user cannot select which `Patient` to delete if they share the same name.  I am not sure about the optimal way to solve this problem. Would deleting by index be better?

I think maybe we can make this more general and apply it all the other *List classes (UniquePatientList, RoomList, TaskList). Otherwise, I think the interface may not be needed?

Instead of tracking `numOfRooms` in a variable, would it be possible to just make use of the size of the `ObservableList`? Maybe include a method to get size (similar to the other *List classes).

I think the current structure is not too bad. Maybe we can rename `clearRoom` to `isNewEmptyRoom` for clarity? `clearRoom` sounds like the name of a method hahaha.

I understand it may be easier to return an `Integer` but this method is similar to the `parseIndex`. We can use the `Index` class provided in the original codebase and use `parseIndex` instead.

Hmm if we modify `RoomList` directly from `EditRoomCommand`, we may be breaking a few abstraction barriers since `Command` will be interacting with `RoomList`.

To avoid this problem, we can add a `setRoom(Room target, Room editedRoom)` method to `RoomList`. Then, add another `setRoom(Room target, Room editedRoom)` method to `Model` (the interface). Finally, In `ModelManager`, call `roomList.setRoom(...)`.

We can then use the `setRoom(...)` method by calling `model.setRoom(...)`. So we are restricting the interactions between classes such that `Command` only interacts with `RoomList` via `Model`.

Okay, I see what you mean. For now, we are treating `RoomNumber` as an index but in the future we may allow the user to set their own room numbers.

If not, I could do that later because I intend to make `ParserUtil` an abstract class.

`getRoomList()` returns the `ObservableList` though. Wouldn't it be possible to check if the room is present from there? 

I think one reason we would not want to return the `RoomList` is because it is mutable. That means that if we return `RoomList` from `ModelManager`, any other class can modify the content through `RoomList` (e.g. call `roomList.addRooms(...)`) instead of through the `Model` (i.e. call `model.addRooms(...)`).

`getRoomList()` returns a read-only list so we can prevent the contents of `RoomList` from being changed directly. In fact, I think that was the original intention behind the `asUnmodifiableObservableList()` method.

Interestingly, `yyyyMd` does not work.

Consider the date "12 Jan 2020", for instance. With `yyyyMd`, it would be "2020112". But this string is ambiguous. Are we referring to "2 Nov 2020" or "12 Jan 2020"?

If we want to use `yyyyMd`, we would need a delimiter (e.g. `yyyy-M-d`). I decided against using the hyphen because it doesn't read as well when it is a date range.

Actually, yeah. It is probably not needed for an MVP.

The rationale behind adding `DateTimeCreated` is to allow the user to filter tasks with creation date as a criterion. For example, in [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-sg/solutions/task-management), users can see when the task is created. It is helpful when the user wants to query what tasks were created yesterday or within the last few days.

Right now, the plan is for the user to click on a `Room` in order to view all tasks assigned to it. There is no separate tab for the users to manage tasks (we should probably have this to show user which tasks from which rooms are due?). In the future, when we implement reminders or a search for tasks, `DateTimeCreated` might be more useful.

I think I will remove this from the MVP. Unit testing for this class also requires more work because we would need another layer of abstraction to handle and control the date-time instead of using `LocalDateTime.now()`.

Thoughts on this?

Additionally, the logic in 'readAndSaveRoomList' unit tests may be difficult to follow without comments. Do you think it would be possible to add

'''
// Save in new file and read back
RoomOccupancyStorage roomOccupancyStorage = new RoomOccupancyStorage(numberOfRooms, roomsOccupied);
// ...
'''

to indicate that you are saving and loading the file for testing?

There is also some code duplication in the 'readAndSaveRoomList' tests, which we can consider refactoring into private methods.

Totally agree with this. Ideally, I think a PR should not exceed 500 lines. It is difficult to review the PR when it is that long. I originally wanted to split this as well. Will definitely do so in the future! 👍

since you are only counting the number of occupied rooms directly, will there be a problem with this? eg.
i have 3 rooms
* room 1
* room 2
* room 3

So lets say ``room 1`` and ``room 3`` are occupied. so ``numberOfRoomsOccupied = 2`` correct? But next time if you load the ``RoomBook``, it will give me ``room 1`` and ``room 2`` occupied since the ``numberOfRoomsOccupied`` is 2?

Yup, adhering to abstraction principle is good, however i feel it might not be worth it to extract only 2 lines of code into a new method. maybe what wl can do is to perhaps give a name to the variable to make it clearer.

i think instead of arraylist, it might be better to use ObservableList directly. ObservableList is what is passed into ListView (UI component) and allows the UI to be updated whenever there is a change in ObservableList.

Hmm, now thinking about it, it does seem like bad design. I'll change this later and update this pr. I will probably use the observablelist.stream().anyMatch to replace this (so it will stay in EditRoomCommand.java but won't have a method) . Do you think its a good idea?

This is one of the dilemma I'm facing. Whether to have a static method in RoomList.java or have a method in EditRoomCommand.java (that is out of place). I think i will adopt the same method of just using the observablelist.stream.anyMatch() method and not create a new method. How does it sound?

I'm not sure if `<ins>` is the correct tag to use here? (And the closing tag should be `</ins>` right) From what I gathered online `<ins>` is to underline some text in html to indicate it is an insertion, but there's not `<del>` tag here, so I think it might be more appropriate to use either the `<u>` tag for underlining or `[]()` syntax if its supposed to be a link

From the [convention guide](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html): Constant names must be all uppercase using underscore to separate words. I'm not sure if countryNotes should be marked 'final' actually, since we are going to modify it in the 'addCountryNote' function.

Also, I feel that the notes should be stored in something like a LinkedHashSet, since we don't really want to add in duplicate notes, and its easier to check if its a HashSet.

Constant names must be all uppercase using underscore to separate words.

Is there a need for this Map? From what I see, I think we can just keep the ISOCountry String array, then check if the entered String is inside, before initializing a new Locale with that String. This way, we won't have to keep so many country objects, since most of the countries likely won't be used.

Hmmm I was thinking that this CountryManager class holds all Country objects, while every other class should be holding references to these objects instead of any new Country() object. That way, the class themselves should be able to check if the Country has any notes, and this method would not be needed.

I think we should just do it now man. From java docs:  Note that it is generally necessary to override the hashCode method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the general contract for the hashCode method, which states that equal objects must have equal hash codes.

Yeah, but usually the purpose of the toString is to return a more "human readable" format of the object, so maybe countryName would be a better choice for the return value.

I would suggest that this is changed to a LinkedHashSet, as we will want the order of the notes to remain the same as the order they were added. HashSet does not guarantee order

Might be good if we remove the telegram prefix, since user has to type @ for email. So we might want to keep the design consistent by making them type @ for telegram handle

Added the following :

JsonAdaptedStudent.java
'''
        if (uuid == null) {
            throw new IllegalValueException(String.format(MISSING_FIELD_MESSAGE_FORMAT, "uuid"));

JsonAdaptedStudentTest.java
'''
    @Test
    public void toModelType_invalidUuid_throwsIllegalValueException() {
        JsonAdaptedStudent student =
                new JsonAdaptedStudent(null, VALID_NAME, VALID_PHONE, VALID_EMAIL, VALID_TAGS);
        String expectedMessage = String.format(MISSING_FIELD_MESSAGE_FORMAT, "uuid");
        assertThrows(IllegalValueException.class, expectedMessage, student::toModelType);
    }
'''

Since UUID is a built-in java class, instead of doing something like '''throw new IllegalValueException(String.format(MISSING_FIELD_MESSAGE_FORMAT, Name.class.getSimpleName()));''' , i opted for '''throw new IllegalValueException(String.format(MISSING_FIELD_MESSAGE_FORMAT, "uuid"));'''

Currently since we are using UUID.randomUUID(), the edge case that could potentially happen is a null UUID rather than that of a UUID that is not specified properly, unless the user decides to edit the uuid in the json file to a smaller uuid string. Hence i decided to only test for toModelType_nullStudentIds_throwsIllegalValueException()

Yes, it applies across all UUIDs so long they are not invalid

An example of an invalid UUID is ```"fffa3023-7d89-426b-ba01-" // No uuid values after dash```

In contrast, a valid uuid is ```"fffa3023-7d89-426b-ba01-d45eaa" // Missing values after d45eaa are padded with zeros```

Actually you can remove the isPersonFound attribute totally. if (personName.equals(nameToSearch) can just return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SEARCH_PERSON_SUCCESS, personFound)) directly. If the execution of code proceeds beyond this for loop, can just throw new CommandException outside. Just a suggestion to keep your code shorter :)

Will be good to include a MESSAGE_SUCCESS attribute or something similar for the string " rooms are added in a hotel" (can refer to the other command classes to see what I mean). 
E.g. in addPatientCommand your have the attribute String MESSAGE_SUCCESS = "New person added: %1$s";
So what you return is return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, numPersonToAdd)) instead of the hardcoded string.

Ok actually I am kind of confused of the flow and purpose of the addNumberOfRooms command. I thought for first time user we will get them to initialise the number of rooms and that will be fixed through out the usage of the app. So addNumberOfRooms in this case should be for initialisation? It doesn't make sense if halfway throughout the usage of the app I suddenly call addNumberOfRooms command again unless I built more rooms for my facility. :/

I am not sure if it is a good idea to make this function static and expose it to the outer world, considering how you also need to call the getRoomList() function from the model to get the ObservableList<Room> as your parameter for this method so the roomList will be from your existing RoomList class anyway  :/. Just a thought to consider!

Hmm I was thinking of having the function "isPatientAssignedARoom" in the Model interface instead. Since the Model contains roomList and the patientRecords, Model knowing whether isPatientAssignedARoom kind of makes sense (essentially it will call on another isPatientAssignedARoom method in the roomList class to get the result).  

I think the key here is that the command should only know of Model and should not be accessing roomList directly. (like the Law of Demeter that we learn for this week) That's what I intend to improve for my deletePatientCommand because I also accessed the patient list directly from model, but I think it's not very well designed since there's a deletePatient command directly from model (original code from address book).

I agree with Ming De I think we should stick to making sure patient does not have the same name. If we delete by index, in the case of 1000 entries, the user may have to scroll too much to find the patient (using searchpatient command doesn't show the index also :/). 
If we just ensure patient cannot have the same name, then all we need to change is the isSamePatient(...) function (to guard against duplicate patient being entered). If we need to check for the age and phone number identifiers, then we may need massive changes for deletepatient and editpatient command :/.
Well, we can justify that the odds of patients having the same name is really very slim haha (https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-probability-of-two-people-having-the-same-name-and-also-living-in-the-same-city)

Looks like you're using the assertion incorrectly, it should be
`assert amount >= 0 : "amount cannot be negative";` instead.

Currently it will print the error message regardless of whether the assertion passed or failed.

Nope, if you try to declare multiple of the same parameters there will be an assertion error somewhere.

Technically you can work around this, by declaring a new class that contains the two parameters, e.g.
the command:
'takeTwoIntegers 1 2'
may have a parameter
'private Parameter<IntPair> param = this.addParameter(..., IntPair::parse)'

and the IntPair class is as follows:
'''java
class IntPair {
  public int a;
  public int b;
  public parse(String str) {
    IntPair result = new IntPair();
    result.a = ...
  }
'''

Don't think any of our commands will involve these kinds of parameters, but if they do we may have to either redesign the command or the parser. (We'll solve that problem when it happens)

Preliminary findings:

 This is actually a symptom of a much bigger problem: **the code is violating SRP and Seperation of Concerns.**

## Context
Right now the model classes (i.e. 'Fridge', 'UniqueFoodList') are throwing these 'RuntimeExceptions' when the food being added is a duplicate etc.

The reason why this has not been a problem so far is because (for the case of the 'DuplicateFoodException') the 2 classes that add to the food list/fridge, the 'AddCommand' and 'EditCommand' have guard clauses that throw an error when a duplicate food item is being added.

'''java
if (!(foodToEdit.equals(editedFood)) && model.hasFood(editedFood)) {
    throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_FOOD);
}
'''
*this one*

Frankly this shouldn't be the job of the 'EditCommand' or 'AddCommand' and now we have to include extra tests to ensure these guard clauses work.

Using the current design, in the future if we add more 'Commands' or other functionality that add 'food' items to the 'model', we will have to keep in mind to catch these duplicates ourselves else oopsies! the program will explode because 'Fridge' threw a 'RuntimeException'.

It is my firm belief that since Java so benevolently offers to handle these problems for us (with checked exceptions), we forgetful humans should gracefully accept its help.

**Note:** I just remembered we're allowing duplicates now but the above argument still applies to the other 'FoodNotFoundException'.

## Proposed Change
Recall the current guard clause used:
'''java
if (!(foodToEdit.equals(editedFood)) && model.hasFood(editedFood)) {
    throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_FOOD);
}
'''
If 'DuplicateFoodException' is thrown as a checked exception, we can easily wrap it in a try-catch:
'''java
try {
    // do the adding here or wtv nonsense
} catch (DuplicateFoodException e) {
    throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_FOOD);
}
'''

Copied over the justification from AB3

'''
PersonNotFoundException is a checked exception. It is thrown by methods
such as 'UniquePersonList#remove(Person)',
'UniquePersonList#setPerson(Person, Person)' etc. to signify that
certain preconditions were not met -- namely that the person provided to
those methods does not exist in the address book/UniquePersonList.

Using checked exceptions for such a purpose is slightly useful in that
it will force callers to handle the case where the above preconditions
are not met, such as when the methods are called with invalid user
input.

However, it imposes a HUGE cost on callers where the preconditions are
already known to be met (e.g. in test code, or when the user input has
already been validated before hand). In such a case, callers are forced
to add try-catch blocks around the method call even if they know that
the exception will never be thrown, bloating up the code. It is also
impossible to test the catch blocks as well since correct code will
ensure that the precondition holds and thus the exception will never be
thrown, leading to reduced code coverage.

Checked exceptions also don't work very well with the Java Streams API,
since the API doesn't accept lambdas which could throw checked
exceptions.

In AB-4, the amount of code which benefits from PersonNotFoundException
being a checked exception is much smaller than the amount of code which
is negatively impacted.

As such, let's make the tradeoff in the other direction, by making
PersonNotFoundException a RuntimeException. New callers _could_ forget
to check that the preconditions hold before calling the methods in
question (although test cases should catch that), but this is balanced
out by the huge benefit of having more concise and testable code.
'''

Only argument I agree with is the 'Java Streams' one, but we can work around this.

We can discuss this in the next team meeting.

Perhaps we can use camelCase for the property names? JSON properties are basically hashmap keys; so just like how we wouldn't use multiple words (with spaces) in a key or variable name (altho JS/JSON allows), maybe we can use `moduleCode` or `module_code` instead?

I think what Shawn said makes sense. It might be better to stick to terms that are already established eg `InternshipStatus`. If I am not wrong does the `status` class exist only for `Internship`? If that is the case, maybe you can consider shifting `date` to the `Internship` object instead and as such, there won't be any ambiguity in the naming.

hmmm, I am not very sure if it should be an exception instead. I was following the assert from oracle java. 
'''
The absence of a default case typically indicates that a programmer believes that one of the cases
will always be executed. The assumption that a particular variable will have one of a small number
of values is an invariant that should be checked with an assertion.

The danger is that if the code is kept and the comments are missed in the future. What is the team's opinion on this? @ZoroarkDarkrai @keanecjy @seanjyjy @shawn-nyk

> I agree that overwriting Javadocs now may be redundant, especially because our code can change over time up until the final version. At the same time, I also agree that we may miss them in the future, and doing a one-time run-through of all our code at the end may be very tedious and error-prone. As such, how about we do something like: every time we create new bits of code that require Javadocs, or we modify code that already has Javadocs attached to them, we place a standardized comment, such as `TODO: Javadocs` above the code we need to write/edit Javadocs for? That way we get the syntax highlighting that IntelliJ provides for the `TODO` keyword, and we can also search for this standardised comment throughout the code base to hone in on where we'll eventually need to write/edit Javadocs when the time comes. Any thoughts on this?

Perhaps its more appropriate a throw an exception here since assertions are mainly to check for precondition and post condition of function execution and testing assumptions. This usage fits neither and is more of an exceptional case?

okay! I tested on my add and delete commands but it doesn't do anything yet. Is there more to the switching besides setting the model state which I have missed from your implementation?

Sounds good! I was thinking of doing so after the other parsers are done since for example the `EditParser` for the `InternshipCommand` may want to abstract 3 items  (comindex, index ,prefixes)? So it depends on implementation of the parsers first then after which we deal with abstraction for common vars.

Hmm. The dilemma now is that this is just a proof of concept and we may be abstracting common logic down the line and scrapping all these, so overwriting Javadocs now may redundant.

> Yup I think that there isn't a need to concern about javadocs / comments as of now as they can be easily fixed at any point in time. @orzymandias I stopped editing the List portions as I noticed that there were too much code duplication with your pr. Do we plan to either extend an `Item` class or use generics for our list?

I agree. I think there is unnecessary duplication for collections, generics is a good idea for collections but one issue is with throwing custom exceptions for different types of items within the generic list. Should we just have DuplicateItemException then something like `throw new DuplicateItemException(T.getDuplicateExceptionMsg())`?

I figured since we all are classifying our classes as `Item`, we can have an `Item` interface to contain all the methods similar methods like `isSameItem` and likewise do `throw new DuplicateItemException(item.getItemName())`?

For `AddCommandParserWrapper` each item has its own set of parsing rules which may require their own individual parsers so the `AddCommandParserWrapper`  is only responsible for funneling the appropriate item prefix to its add parser. The thing about delete command parser is that there is lesser parsing involved except for extracting out the index to be deleted. With the exception of internship which has an additional index required, all the other commands just need the index extracted to be passed to their delete commands. So I am not sure there is a need a wrapper in that case. 

As for consistency I think once AddCommandParser can be safely removed, we can rename `AddCommandParserWrapper` to `AddCommandParser`.

The rationale behind using java String#trim on `Phone` was to remove leading and trailing whitespaces. When considering the user's `dateTime` input do we need to consider white spaces inside the string as well? For e.g. "01-01-2020 1200" vs "01-01-2020   1200" if we are not going to trim it then perhaps we need to consider adding an exception for this and add the corresponding unit test.

this method is to list out the message constraints, in order to have a nice grammatically correct message the last type of task in this String should not contain a comma after it

This copy of valid visit is hard coded, by using the visit builder class. The hard coded values are retrieved using the getOneBased method. Valid visit has no direct reference to filtered visit at all.

The gist of this test is that my model's filtered lists for person and location currently store only 1 location with id 3 and 1 person with id 4. This is done using the showLocationAtIndex, showPersonAtIndex methods above. Im giving the model input using index 1 and index 1 for person and location, because the list user sees contains only 1 element. After processing however, I am expecting the visit to point to ids 3 and 4 respectively. This is done by comparing the final visit from the visit list with the expected visit created using valid visit.

Pull Request Approval:

Before approving any pull requests, please ensure the following is done.

1. Eyeballing the code for any possible logic or other errors. This is also to familiarise yourself with implementation of the system.

2. Pull the pull request down into a local branch and give the features a test run. This is to check whether it actually works since eyeballing code may not be fool proof in ensuring functionality.

I feel that the command could be better named, for example using "edittemplatename" instead.

I mean the toString, equality, hashcode tests. Could use VALID_WAGE, VALID_PERIOD, etc? If it's a better practice to use "Sunday", "React Native", etc. it's fine then.

Sure then! I just thought maybe using constants could make it easier to see, that creating an object with the same input will result to an equal one. Like 2 objects created with VALID_PERSON_ALICE are equals but not with one created with VALID_PERSON_BOB.
LGTM!

When I thought on how to handle the program's logic, I found out that putting lessons and tasks in Module will make it way harder to find/delete tasks & lessons. Instead, I think that we just keep lessons and tasks in separate lists and everytime we need to find lessons or tasks of a module, we can just do a O(n) search. This will make the program's logic much simpler and less prone to errors

I assume we're using Person's Name and Phone classes for now since they help guarantee certain text properties.

Perhaps we could name this `InternshipStatus` or something along those lines instead? Do let me know if I'm mistaken, but it seems that we have a Job class that has the variables - jobTitle, companyName and industry. So this status object should be reflective of an Internship status rather than a Job status? Shall we ensure that "Job" and "Internship" are not interchangeable terms throughout our code base? Another issue that might still arise even after changing the name to `InternshipStatus` is that we will then have a `Status` and `InternshipStatus` class, and it may not be obvious what the difference is between the 2 in terms of their names? Would it be possible/better to make this a private enum within the Status class?

As we'll also need to add Jobs in a company object, this `Job` object seems to differ implementation-wise from the `Job` object that we may use for company objects, though they should probably be the same? For example, in a `Company` object, during its creation via a user command, the user can input multiple industries and jobs that a company has. This creates the `Company` object, along with its multiple jobs and industries. So in those `Job` objects in the `Company` object, will each of them have multiple industries tagged to them instead of just one industry as in this `Job` object? Also, since a `Company` stores `Job` objects, would this create a cyclical dependency if we change the `Name companyName` part to `Company company` in the future (I assume we will)? At this juncture, it seems that if `Job` is going to store Company and Industry, perhaps we may not even need `Job` objects? Perhaps we could simply use String (or Name) for jobs? This may also help to synchronize with how jobs will have to be represented in a `Company` object.

Ah I see, thanks for the clarification! I think the `Status` and `ApplicationStatus` names suggested work, but perhaps sticking to `InternshipStatus` might still be better so we don't introduce more terms for the same object (for e.g. application and internship both refer to internship applications)? So maybe swapping the current `Status` and `InternshipStatus` names will do? May have to consult the rest haha, just some suggestions!

I see we've changed the tab name from plural to singular. I was wondering if it would be odd since the user would be looking at a tab labelled "Company" but in it can be multiple companies?

This works if all our commands require a switch? At the moment that seems to be the case apart from the help and exit commands if I'm not mistaken. Also, I suppose it depends on how we want our app to behave exactly - do we want it to switch every time a command is executed even if the user is already on the right page, or do we want to switch only if the user is on the wrong page? I suppose this may not be detectable visually unless the switching of tabs introduces its own behavior (for example if switching causes the list of cards to jump to the top of the list, and not switching allows the user to stay at wherever they've scrolled to in the list, then executing a command that always switches vs. one that only switches when necessary will provide different user experiences).

True, this class is indeed very similar to the Name class. However, in order to do the following:
> pass in the messageConstraints to signify a different error message if need to

perhaps we can modify the Name class to, say, take in an extra argument in its constructor for the `messageConstraints` variable, and then the passing in of this variable could be done by the Industry class that extends the Name class and simply passes its own messageConstraints through the parent (i.e. Name's) constructor via super(). As such, we'll reduce code duplication but still maintain the existence of the Industry class. I feel that it may be necessary to have such unique classes because variables such as `private final Set<Industry> industries = new HashSet<>();` would look rather odd as `private final Set<Name> industries = new HashSet<>();`. And ultimately, in order to "pass in the messageConstraints to signify a different error message if need to", I believe we'll still need to have some sort of *Name as parent class for subclasses such as Industry, Descriptor, Requirement, etc.* arrangement, since Industry is not the only class affected by this / has this characteristic.

All that said, modifying Name and abstracting all the common fields to subclass from it at this juncture would be inappropriate in the context of this PR. Would it be okay if we let this portion through first and do the necessary abstraction / refactoring after all 4 items (inclusive of this Company item) are present in our codebase, as discussed in our Tele group?

I can't shift it straight into the current if-else block due to the nature of the condition checking. If we want to make it all part of one block, here's an option:
'''
if (model.getTabName() != TabName.APPLICATION) {
    model.setTabName(TabName.APPLICATION);
    shouldSwitchTab = true;
    model.setViewIndex(targetIndex);
} else if (model.getViewIndex().equals(targetIndex)) {
    resultMessage = messageAlreadyViewing;
    shouldSwitchDisplay = false;
} else {
    model.setViewIndex(targetIndex);
}
'''
But this means 'model.setViewIndex(targetIndex)' appears twice.

Another option is to simply remove the if condition and do:
'''
if (model.getTabName() != TabName.APPLICATION) {
    model.setTabName(TabName.APPLICATION);
    shouldSwitchTab = true;
    model.setViewIndex(targetIndex);
} else if (model.getViewIndex().equals(targetIndex)) {
    resultMessage = messageAlreadyViewing;
    shouldSwitchDisplay = false;
}

model.setViewIndex(targetIndex);
'''
But this means that even when the model's view index is already the index that the user inputs, we still set it anyway (unnecessary call to setViewIndex). It won't affect the program though.

Between the current code and these 2 options, which do yall think is better? Or are there other alternatives yall may have?

Hi Keane! Unfortunately that would not be possible. Variables can't be declared in an if-else block and then used outside of it due to variable scope. Even doing something as simple as:
'''
if (true) {
    boolean shouldSwitchTab = false;
} else {
    boolean shouldSwitchTab = false;
}
shouldSwitchTab = true; // line X
'''
Will lead to an error on line X whereby it doesn't detect that shouldSwitchTab has been initialized.
(More on it here: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17444020/why-cant-variables-be-declared-in-an-if-statement](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17444020/why-cant-variables-be-declared-in-an-if-statement#:~:text=Because%20when%20b%20goes%20out,in%20the%20next%20if%20statement.&text=So%20here%20scope%20of%20b,it%20is%20giving%20compilation%20error.))

To justify having these boolean vars initialized and declared where they are, we can take it that by default, we assume the user in on the appropriate tab (`shouldSwitchTab = false`) and not viewing the current item (`shouldSwitchDisplay = true`) which is why they would want to execute the view command in the first place. However, they may happen to be on the wrong tab (first if statement checks for that), or they may happen to be on the right tab and already viewing the item (the following else-if statement checks for that). That is how I would intend the code to be read!

Ah good question! I raised this in our Tele group last night, but basically how the view index works is that it takes the index from the tab that is currently in view. So for example, if a user is on say the Application tab and he is viewing the 3rd Application, if he executes `view com 3`, if we do not check for the tab first, then the program will simply think we're already viewing the 3rd item so it doesn't need to do anything, which is wrong of course. That said, now that you've raised this point, I believe I may be able to abstract away the first if statement, but I'll definitely need that condition check in the else-if statement that checks for if the user is on the same tab and currently viewing the indexed item. So I can minimize the tab checking but we need that one minimally.

Oh if that's the case, sure I don't mind changing it! But then again I'm not sure if our evaluators have the same understanding though? For example when we eventually evaluate our peers' work, I would probably follow the coding standard to cross-check my evaluation and if I spotted this violation in their work, I would probably just mark it as a violation since it is stated in black and white and not have to think too much. If you have the source, could you point me to where Prof Damith mentioned that we could do otherwise? Would be much appreciated!

> Hmm. The dilemma now is that this is just a proof of concept and we may be abstracting common logic down the line and scrapping all these, so overwriting Javadocs now may redundant. The danger is that if the code is kept and the comments are missed in the future. What is the team's opinion on this? @ZoroarkDarkrai @keanecjy @seanjyjy @shawn-nyk

I agree that overwriting Javadocs now may be redundant, especially because our code can change over time up until the final version. At the same time, I also agree that we may miss them in the future, and doing a one-time run-through of all our code at the end may be very tedious and error-prone. As such, how about we do something like: every time we create new bits of code that require Javadocs, or we modify code that already has Javadocs attached to them, we place a standardized comment, such as `TODO: Javadocs` above the code we need to write/edit Javadocs for? That way we get the syntax highlighting that IntelliJ provides for the `TODO` keyword, and we can also search for this standardised comment throughout the code base to hone in on where we'll eventually need to write/edit Javadocs when the time comes. Any thoughts on this?

Line 43 executes a function that creates delete int commands and executes them, causing the model's internal tab name to be set to company. Thus, before that line is executed, we need to save the current actual tab the user is on, which is done in line 40. Since we are checking against this saved tab instead of the model's current tab (would become company because of line 43), we cannot use the `CommandUtil.getCommandResult()` method.

Perhaps you could test for multiple predicates too. 

One suggestion would be to create your school/year predicate too and then create a `FindStudentDescriptor` from it, then have a method in `testutils.StudentUtils` that converts it into "n/... s/... y/..." form, similar to how it is done in `parseCommand_edit()`. The outcome would be:
`FindCommand.COMMAND_WORD + " " + StudentUtils.getFindCommandDetails()`

Additionally, if you are using prefixes, you might want to refer to them by how they are defined in `CliSyntax` instead of magic literals.

`Year` is actually a String now that accepts alphanumeric characters. Hence I think we should relax the requirements to be one where it returns true if `student.getYear().year` contains the keyword (e.g. `year` could be a String and it is matched using `StringUtils::containsWordIgnoreCase`). 
That way, if you search "4" you could get those who put "Sec 4", "sec 4" or "Secondary 4" if the user is inconsistent.

It also means you will be less likely to land an `IllegalArgumentException` if the user parses an invalid string since right now `FindCommandParser` currently has to call `Year#new` to construct this.

Would it be more helpful if we made it look only for words that contain all the keywords (even incomplete ones)? (i.e. `AND` search)

`return keywords.stream().map(String::toLowerCase).allMatch(year::contains);`

In here and elsewhere, should we follow the user stories as closely as the gdoc since it's more or less cross-checked among ourselves? i.e. for this line of code, can it be 'contact the right person if needed'?

Time is compulsory for LocalDateTime in java.time so unless a dummy time is added in, LocalDateTime cannot be used.
I think it would be cumbersome to try to differentiate between the dummy time and the actual time if any. I think this mainly has to do with the backend part.
Then since the time and date is separated, it would easier to parse them separately.

After checking the hierarchy of java.time, I realised the only common class ancestor of Date, Time and DateTime is java.lang.Object but they do implement similar interfaces. So I decided to make Date, Time and DateTime to implement a common Instance interface instead of a common class. And also if Date and Time inherit from the same class, it would imply that Date and Time is comparable.

Is the sort method supposed to sort the current shown list? Or is it supposed to sort the full list of contacts before showing it? Because the former would be much easier to implement and I believe is what we intended to do originally? There is the `model.getFilteredPersonList()` method which gives the last shown list.

Also, I agree with the Hendey's comment about the sortPerson method. I do not think that all the model classes need to have such a method.

The method was added for the following reasons:
1. The Person and Visit classes both have these two methods in Model - getFiltered[x]List() and updateFiltered[x]List() where x is either of those classes. As the InfoHandler class requires the getFilteredLocationList(), I felt it was apt that updateFilteredLocationList() was added as well.
2. Also, the addLocation method in the ModelManager requires the updateFilteredLocationList() as well.

As for the test above, the function is required to be overwritten for the ModelStub to be created.

## Issues
### Format
When creating an issue, try to specify the part of the project the issue is meant to be working on by using square brackets in the title. If the issue does not specify anything, it is assumed to be implementation-based, i.e., related to modifying AB3/VirusTracker code. 

Example: `[DG] Add UC01 and UC02` indicates that this issue works on adding user cases 01 and 02 to the developer guide.

### Labeling
**Mandatory label**:
 * `priority.*` Indicates the priority level of the task. Has three levels, low, medium and high.

Apart from the mandatory priority label, you may include other labels to make it easier to search and locate issues. Feel free to add any labels, but please _**ensure no similar label already exists**_.

## Pull Requests

General note: PRs can only be merged only when two or more other people have reviewed and approved of the merge.

### Format for PR 
When creating the PR, please state which issues the PR closes on the last line of the description.

**Commit message:** 'keyword #xx, keyword #yy, keyword #zz' for multiple issues
* 'keyword' refers to any one of the following three words, 'close', 'fix', 'resolve'.
   * Using these keywords will cause the issue to be automatically closed once the PR is merged successfully.
   * _Note: Other tenses for the above words could be used as well, such as 'closes' or 'closed', but let us standardise using the 
     imperative form of the words above._
* '#xx' references the issue number, where xx is the number. For example, xx = 10 will reference issue number 10.

 Example: xx = 30
'''
...PR description here

Close #xx
''' 
The above will close issue 30 upon the successful merging of the PR. 
_The actual form of #xx is not used in this comment as it would reference actual issues. Please refer to the PRs page for more examples._

The issue is with RescheduleCommand only having the [INDEX] which takes care of the problem when [INDEX] > total schedules, but in Parser, I'm not able to retrieve the filteredSessionList as it requires Model to retrieve it, so FitEgo can't detect the issue when input session is higher than total sessions.
> 
>     3. Testing for this Reschedule is not fully up yet because there isn't a ScheduleCommandTestUtil class, not sure if this is required because now it's a bit tricky in a sense that Schedule contains Client and Session while RescheduleDescriptor contains clientIndex and sessionIndex of Index class. If RescheduleDescriptor were to contain Client and Session, it should be easier but in RescheduleCommandParser, similar to issue 2 above, I'm not able to retrieve the filteredSessionList as it requires Model to retrieve it.

try to detect the issue in command.execute() instead of parser?

From commit 9b2ccce:

In process of Unittesting, dificulty was encountered from utilising
testing utilities of original code base.

Specifically the assertCommandSuccess testutil method, relies on the .equals
of model manager, and model manager equality has null values initialised for AB3
and Inventoryinator versions, which if implemented to check, cause testcase
failures in stubs.

Recommended to perform refactor to code base and remove ab3 artifacts, for more effective
testing.

Will open new issue based on this finding.

@seanjyjy @orzymandias @ZoroarkDarkrai @shawn-nyk 
I think this is a good topic for discussion. Currently, AB3 only uses the weaker notion of equality, `isSameItem` for the edit command. The add command on the other hand checks based on the `equals` method. Do we want to change it such that it uses the same notion of equality as well?

Yes haha, I had a good laugh earlier when I represented wage as a Phone object. Reason I did so was to use AB3's current implementation of the `Name` object (which is basically a class with a string containing only AlphaNumeric characters) and `Phone` object (which is essentially a class with a string containing only Numeric characters). I think that we can rename it in the near future and make use of them in all our classes. What do you think?

Yup, I think its best if we could ensure that the "Job" and "Internship" names are not used loosely throughout the code base. I don't particularly like the idea of a nested class, since I do intend to use the enum outside of this Status class (for parsing and input). Also, would it better to rename the `Status` class as `ApplicationStatus` and the enum to be called `Status` instead?

deepDelete uses the `isSameItem` method defined in the abstract Item class, which compares 2 items based on the weaker notion of equality, which I defined it to be comparing only the internship item. Hence why I created the deepDelete method! I will change the method name to `deleteSameItem`, hopefully its clearer that way.

Yup I think that there isn't a need to concern about javadocs / comments as of now as they can be easily fixed at any point in time. @orzymandias I stopped editing the List portions as I noticed that there were too much code duplication with your pr.

> ecessary duplication for collections, generics is a good idea for collections but one issue is with throwing custom exceptions for different types of items within the generic list. Should we just have DuplicateItemException then something like `throw new DuplicateItemException(T.getDuplicateExceptionMsg())`?

I don't think this works because we are not able to access methods in java generics. I figured since we all are classifying our classes as `Item`, we can have an `Item` interface to contain all the methods similar methods like `isSameItem` and likewise do `throw new DuplicateItemException(item.getItemName())`?

Not too sure what's the correct which is the correct way, but I just thought that doing it this way by writing 2 strings that are different objects would be better since we will be comparing periods with different strings in the actual implementation too

Initially it was because `ClientUtil.java` needed to build the command given the client's details, I changed the implementation of `getClientDetails` to explicitly use `getCountryCode()` so this function isn't currently in use now. I thought it would make sense to have `countryCode` since that is the value passed into the object like the other fields.

Actually, we cannot call `this.class` before the object is initiated. Therefore, `this.class.getName()` cannot be put in either `Macronutrient`'s constructor or a static method.

I think it may be easier to check at the BidBook / UniqueBidList level (or even AddBidCommand, I'm not sure where is the best place yet), so that Bid does not know about PropertyBook. Maybe can think about this further in the future, but for now it's okay since other stuff is not done yet.

I'm not sure if we can follow the original client find command, because for that command, we don't have to parse the different prefixes. Whereas for findsvc, we need to parse for both title and service code and ensure that only one of them is chosen. Can see @yanlynnnnn 's findexp command to see how she did hers.

Yup he did, but I needed to extend it with more methods. I need a contains method with parameter ServiceCode to check if the service code belongs to an existing service. I can't just insert that as a generic method to Unique List, so I created UniqueServiceList to extend UniqueList<Service>.

'ModelManager::filteredTransactions' was ideally supposed to contain both expenses and incomes from 'FinanceTracker::expenses' and 'FinanceTracker::incomes', through the methods 'FinanceTracker::getExpenseList' and  'FinanceTracker::getExpenseList' while completely omitting 'FinanceTracker::transactions'. Thus, 'ModelManager' would have 3 lists while 'FinanceTracker' would have 2.

However, the implementation of the class 'FilteredList' is that one of its fields ('source') is an 'ObservableList' object, and constructing a 'FilteredList' as such:
'''java
ObservableList<E> observableList = FXCollections.observableArrayList()
FilteredList<E> filteredList = new FilteredList(observableList);
'''
would result in 'source = observableList'.

In essence, a 'FilteredList' object needs to keep track of an 'ObservableList' object.

Thus, 'filteredTransactions' needs to keep track of its own 'ObservableList' object, and cannot track both 'expenses' and 'incomes' together. Therefore, 'FinanceTracker::transactions' cannot be removed, and neither can the class 'TransactionList'.

Are we going to pass Logic object (only) in the UiManager for later iterations? 
So that UI is only directly associated with Logic object, and Logic object will decide which Logics (LogicMode, LogicPerson, LogicMeeting, or LogicDeliverable) to call.

Was thinking if this can be improved to maintain the same level of abstraction as before, by constructing the Leave object with ` public Leave(LocalDate from, LocalDate to) ` because in other cases for example, 
Add Person, the text input goes from `Logic` -->  `AddressBookParser` --> `AddCommandParser` and this is where the Name, Email, Address Objects are made, then these objects are passed into `AddCommand` and is then passed into Model to add the person. 
I think this change does not make a difference logic wise, but helps make the level of abstraction more standard. But up to you to take it up.

The Timer class is only used to keep track of the active timers. Once the timer is stopped, the data is stored under a WorkDuration class (which has not reference to project), and put in a list inside the corresponding project.

I implemented it this way because I didn't want to store incomplete timers in a project, since it might cause problems if the timer wasn't stopped properly. Its also easier to check for active timers this way (see activeTimer in ModelManager)

And i think it would be easier to extend to having multiple concurrent timers if we decide to do that (then each timer needs to know which project its keeping track of)

Just storing the index won't work because the filtered list might change while the timer is running.

This is mostly what i was referring to when i said more/better tests are needed.

Basically, since I'm using LocalDateTime.now() to get the current time, 2 times will never be exactly the same (they will be some nanoseconds apart). For example in tests, even if I start 2 timers immediately after one another, they will have different values, so equals() will still say that they're different. Since the existing tests involve checking if 2 models are equal, this will break a bunch of existing tests.

I'm think of either (a) Overloading the timer functions so that I can start them at a fixed time (just for testing) or (b) Introduce a custom global clock for the application to run on. The global clock will be the same as system clock in production, but in testing it will have functions that allow us to manually control the time.

A user will never see this message (as of now) since we don't require users to manually input times. If we add commands that involve time inputs, then it might be better to not use ISO8601 format in the first place (its hard to read) and instead use some variation of the "yyyy MM dd hh:mm:ss" style.

This error only come up in logs when theres an error in loading saved data (e.g. the saved data is not in ISO format). For now I'll add an example of what the format looks like to the error message

Yup, should keep both. "e/" for emergency contact, "p/" for employee's contact number.

I'm not sure if "set" is a prefix and need to add into here. Based on my understanding, we only need to add new prefix when we need to create a new field in a person model. Like if we create a field to record remarks, then we need to add "r/" as a prefix. But "set" does not function in this way. When user key in "set ...", then program will execute the "set", not to add the values behind to a field.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, thanks 😃

Maybe you could consider using `case structure` here? It looks clearer, but `if` is working perfectly. 👍

yes, it is designed to modify its input arguments. this wouldn't be necessary if java had some semblance of decent features after 14 versions, like pattern matching;

this is how i use bisect in a proper language:
'''cpp
std::string_view x;
std::string_view xs;

std::tie(x, xs) = util::bisect(input, ' ');
if(x.empty()) return { };

if(x[0] == '@')
{
	parse_tags(msg, x);
	std::tie(x, xs) = util::bisect(xs, ' ');
}

if(x[0] == ':')
{
	parse_prefix(msg, x);
	std::tie(x, xs) = util::bisect(xs, ' ');
}
'''

unfortunately this can't be done in java (there's no 'std::tie' equivalent, nor can there ever be). rather than introduce loads of syntactic noise by needing to (a) declare a pair to store the bisectionr result; (b) declare or assign a variable for the first part; (c) declare or assign a variable for the second part, it is more convenient this way.

besides, 'bisect()' clearly documents its mutating behaviour.

for this kind of boolean parameter, i suggest doing something like this:
'''suggestion
        return new CommandResult(SHOWING_HELP_MESSAGE, /* showHelp: */ true, /* exit: */ false);
'''
so that it's easier to see what the 'true' and 'false' mean without going into the definition of the class/function.

It's for testing purposes and to also remind programmers under what conditions this call should be made only. I wrote this with the intention that the programmer should only call setToAccommodationList() if the directory is a Travelplan. I was thinking about try catch, but it's not a scenario the user will face, since this should be configured by programmers (and should not happen because of user input/calls). It's also okay to write try catch, but there should not be any exception in the first place unless there is a bug in the program.

Edit: checkstyle throwing an error when I made a change.

Yea that was the intention to just init countryNotes from the start so there wouldn't be any bugs if someone using Country forgot to check if countryNotes exists. If there is a noticeable lag then probably can optimise in v1.3.

Save file can just store countries which actually have countryNotes in them, so no need to store all countries.

My idea is that whenever you are interacting with the existing `Country` instances (other than just getting country notes), you should only do it via `CountryManager`. I think this layer of abstraction is good especially for logging/debugging in the future since `Model` only needs to operate on `CountryManager` and I would be able to log all `Country` method calls.

For classes like the `CountryNoteParser` or `CountryFilterParser` they should not be holding references to the existing Country as they do not have a reference to `CountryManager`. Only `Model` has a reference to `CountryManager`. So when a `Command` executes on a `Model`, then they are able to check for duplicate notes, etc.

Also, `Country` has a `hasCountryNote` method, but I purposely made it `protected` so that only `CountryManager` can call that method. Other classes should only be able to call the constructor and `getCountryNote` method of `Country` only.

Would be good if you can include the `toString()` methods for the Answer and Question class, that way when it is implemented in the GUI it would be easier to render it seperately (since the current way to access the string form of the question and answer is through the Flashcard class). 

The current `toString()` method in FlashCard is still useful when interacting with the application through CLI 👍

Looks good! Just wondering whether it would be better if we made userAnswer an Answer type also, that way we can potentially do more things with it in the future. 

If userAnswer was an Answer type, we can just override `.equals()` as a way of comparison to check if userAnswer is indeed Answer.

okay I have resolved this. The original AB3 uses this method as a weaker notion of equality between students. Because if we check all field && then it will become the equals method. But since we defined student to have this 4 compulsory fields, we can update it to check these fields. But I think we should not include the checks for admin fields when it comes in.

Good point. This would make searching and filtering the `year` data easier. Based on this, I guess we may have to exhaust all possible levels of student that a tutor may have? My concern is that IP, IB, MOE mainstream tracks have different naming in their levels. Furthermore, there could be other level naming, for eg a tutor teaching music or arts may have different levels naming for their students.

> @xnoobftw one way is to not put preferences.json inside gitignore, but this default value is meant for first time users. Since all of us are developers, its okay to delete it (because users perspective as first time users they will not have the preferences.json)

Perhaps we can make use of the regex method used by the other classes in model? In this case the validation format would be "^(3[01]|[12][0-9]|0[1-9])/(1[0-2]|0[1-9])/[0-9]{4}$" for dd/mm/yyyy. I believe it would make our code seem more in line with the existing code from AB-3.

I believe a better comparison would be between Leave and Address or Tag! Leave should handled the same way as how an attribute of the person is handled instead of being handled the same way as the Person itself. But you are right, I can have the parsing method imported from dateUtil to achieve better abstraction.

@halcon-blanco i'm fine with this, since we might need to change again in the future into 3 sections so no issue. For the colouring, is it easy to implement colouring to be conditional (red vs green if stock falls below 20%)? If its a huge task we can create a separate task.

Low priority: I didn't do the GUI for help toolbar on top to open up the 2 different help windows since the app is meant for CLI primarily. But feel free to connect them if you want :)

I think instead of writing in a point form, it could be written in full sentences. The language used here also feels informal and incomplete.
Some examples could be:
- More convenient than typical apps as lessons and assignments are managed in just one app so there is no need to switch between different ones.
- Easier to manage schedule than typical scheduling apps as assignments are automatically scheduled.

@AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-3/developers , @mkeoliya and I had a long discussion on how this value adds to our users. We weren't really able to find a concrete use case for this feature. Can anyone think of why this would be useful for our target users? We're leaning towards lowering the priority of (or even scrapping altogether) this User Story.

OTOH, we further refined our concept of the export feature, which we're documenting in #52 .

Just a thought, shouldn't the validVisit be created based on the hard coded locationId INDEX_THIRD and personId INDEX_FOURTH? Right now valid visit still references the filtered list. If there's an error in the translation of ids between filtered list and the original lists, the test would still pass as both the AddVisitCommand and validVisit would have made the same error.

Yep something similar currently "sec 3" would match "sec 1-4", "p 3" and "s 3" but not "p3" or "s3" as it matches by whole words so "p3" is not "sec" or "3" hence it won't match. Same for "s3"!

Why will there be an error message after the tag is created (Line 326-328)? Maybe you can write it this way(?):
MSS
1. User requests to add a tag.
2. Projact adds a tag.
Use case ends.

Extensions
2a. The tag already exists.
2a1. Projact shows an error message.
Use case ends.

Is this clearer haha and also must we show in the use case that there are 2 ways to add a tag (like in user guide) or a general one (seen above) is ok?

This is for us to get available rooms based on which Rooms we currently have that are booked. But the booking class only contains the room ids and not the Room object so the input may be a list of integer IDs instead? Depends on how we implement the rest so I think can leave it for now!

Yo! Regarding this:

> But when you use the old select command, ModelManager gets told to operate on the selected deck and stops operating on the stub deck
> Remember when I said the UI is tied to the stub decks UniqueEntryList field? This means that even though you are updating the selected decks list, nothing changes in the UI because nothing changes in the stub's UniqueEntryList

Could you please provide steps to reproduce the issue? What I did are as follow:

I resolved the concurrent modification issue caused by 'replaceEntryList()' in 'ModelManager.java' by changing the method body to:
'''java
public void replaceEntryList() {
    observedDeck.setEntries(getCurrentDeck().getEntries());
}
'''
I don't think removing all entries in 'observedDeck.entries' is necessary since 'observedDeck.setEntries(...)' will directly replace the old 'entries' with new 'entries'. Java garbage collector will handle the rest.

Next, I launched the program and issued the following command:
'''
add w/test_word t/test_translate
'''
and expected to see no update to the UI. However, I saw my new entry appear beneath all the stub entries.

I re-launched the program and tested these commands:
'''
select 1
add w/test_word t/test_translate
'''
and saw my new entry appear beneath all the stub entries too.

I did attempt to place the EPIC within each section, but github markdown does not allow you to create merged cells. So the sentence is wrapped within the a small single cell. I would suggest, if we want to include the epics, to create a separate table and reference the [EPICS] accordingly.

@Wincenttjoi I've made the changes you requested, plus changed the whole structure of the DeliveryList GUI to match that of the ItemList. (Tonnes of headache cuz debugging GUI is super hard).

Just tested with the current `master` branch code, 0 does not remove the role from the shift yet, but instead shift-edit removes all roles, then add the ones keyed in. Do we want to have the 0 = remove functionality, or just not allow 0 to be keyed in?

I think it's okay to init it for now. We could probably KIV this for further optimisations if it's ever a problem down the road? 
I agree with the case when there will be many countries and this poses a real problem though.

Initialising probably makes for easy testing for now as well.

The extension is specific to step 2 of the MSS ("TBM shows a list of clients that match user's query"), hence the extension should be named `2a` instead of `1a` isn't it?

edit: yeap, the suggestion by ming chong is correct, I'll change it to what he suggested, ref to this for similar example, the "error" check happens after the actor (user) submits:

`list` is an AB3 command, I didn't add that in actually. Instead, I copied over from our HackMD file what I had to add in.
that's why `person` persisted and wasn't changed to `clients`

Agree with the code quality aspects pointed out by @qwoprocks  if we go by what the textbook outlines for static final variables.  

Premature optimisation might be unnecessary for now, but it's a minor aspect imo, @raysonkoh should make the design decision on this.

I think creating new commands will add unnecessary complexity to the system. It will take a lot of effort to set up even if we only provide for a small number of commands in the compound command. Even then, it will not provide much value since it will not take a lot of time to type a small number of commands, especially if aliasing is done well.

Some of your CI (Continuous Integration) checks have failed so you have to change it before we can merge the pull request. You can find out what is the issue by clicking on details > clicking the "..." button on the right > then lastly, clicking on full screen.

The errors will be the lines before the red alert message. It looks like there are some formatting issues with this pull request. For example:

-  ERROR:../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Email.java:66: no newline at EOF.

This means that there is no empty line at the end of the Email.java file. Hence, you would have to rectify that to maintain formatting standards with the rest of the program.

### Select command has been fixed

**Fixing the UI**

I found out that during initialization, the wrong output of the method getFilteredEntryList() from ModelManager.java gets passed to the UI. This meant that the UI was watching the first decks UniqueEntryList. 

I changed it so that now the UI watches observedEntries from the PUBLIC field in AddressBook.java. 

_Hence, any changes to observedEntries from AddressBook.java will directly result in a change to the GUI._

**Select Command**

I edited the Select Command to now directly change the observedEntries, the low level details are documented in the code. 

Essentially, it creates a copy of the observedEntries, then deletes the original entries. It then fills observedEntries with entries of the selected command. The reason why we have to create a direct copy is to avoid the concurrent modification exception. Not the best performance O(n^2 * m) but performance can be optimized later.

**Issues**

The modification to AddressBook.observedEntries is done directly (because observedEntries is a public field), we should change this in the future. 

Now edit command has to be updated, please refer to the code I have written to get an idea on how to do it.

List command can be deleted as well

Clear command needs to be updated as well (should it clear decks or clear entries?)


**Homework for you guys:** 
- Fix the edit command such that it displays the edit command (for now, it only edits the deck's entrybut doesn't show it)
- Determine if list command needs to be deleted and delete/not delete it accordingly
- Do the same for clear command

Tested locally. All storage related tests passed. 

For TestDriver.java, if I run it multiple times, the data will be stored repeatedly into testingForExercise.json. Is that the desired outcome or should you first clear the file and then store the exercise book? (not sure about this)

Otherwise LGTM.

Those tests are for AB3. The tests throw a lot of incompatible errors because I modified the original classes (AddCommand, AddCommandParser etc.) instead of creating new ones.

The TestDriver is created to ensure that I can read and write from the data. 
 The reason for the repeats is because it reads all the items in the storage, can't realize that items with same name and date are the same (cuz i am using stubs) and just add items at the end of the list.
The TestDriver also includes reading from past records and add the same set of Exercise at the end.

Pushed a fix regarding the issue above. 

This implementation also allows the user to edit the default profile picture to something of their choice, by editing `data/stock_picture.png`. If the user wants to return to the default profile picture, they can just delete `data/stock_picture.png` and the app will automatically regenerate the file on the next run.

I'm not sure if this should be added into the User Guide, since it's a niche use case.

In the process of coding my own tests, I found that the test code heavily depends on variable file paths, and it would be hard to write test code for the sections with hardcoded paths.

As testability is a grading criterion (I think?), I am increasing the priority of this issue.

Okay with moving it to session and changing the keyword to sview. Not sure if there's a need to use p/ tags since there's only 2 variations in mind now. But if so, `sview p/week` and `sview p/all`? Think we can discuss it later

Change to a clearer def. Since TBM performs basic contact management/tracking, the use case should be able to handle the scenario when the user inadvertently tries to add a duplicate entry for someone he might already have an entry. (Could be due to previous professional deals, working relations... etc that he forgot.). Duplicate entries would cause the archives to get messy, and so I added the case where TBM prevents/User does not add the duplicate entry.

The new business deal might involve some party which the user has encountered before and thus might have an entry in TBM, but forgot. So I wrote the uc in a vague way to put in the duplicate entry uc. @raysonkoh

Can't pass CI due to checkstyle error in RemarkCommandTest.java.
Checkstyle document says to put "import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test" **after** the "import static seedu" statements, but upon doing that, it says that the "import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test" is **lexicographically before** the "import static seedu" statements, and should be put before them. I don't know how to solve this checkstyle conflict.
