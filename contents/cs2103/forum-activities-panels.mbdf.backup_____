## Library

[PlantUML GitHub Action](https://github.com/cloudbees/plantuml-github-action)

Dependency: [Git Auto Commit Action](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action)

## Purpose

Automatically generate and commit PlantUML pngs when .puml files are updated, so as to eliminate the manual labor of exporting each .puml file as an image whenever they are changed. Also, this allows people reviewing the PR to see the visual result of the UML changes on GitHub itself, which is convenient sometimes.

I've uploaded a sample .yml file as a .txt file [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/files/5361514/workflow.txt) for those that want to use this as well, if approved 

Edit: After some tinkering, I've updated the .yml file to fix some issues, you can get it [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/files/5363959/workflow.txt)


## License

PlantUML GitHub Action has no license indicated, but it runs the PlantUML tool which is under the [GPL License](https://plantuml.com/faq#5037030214953880)

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: Walking skeleton for tP**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/274" expanded>

I would like to ask if the walking skeleton approach conflicts with the instructions for our breadth-first iterative approach? 

From the images below, the breadth-first approach says that "Adding all data classes first" is a bad thing, but it seems that a walking skeleton would be basically doing that, albeit just creating dummy data classes, unless my understanding of a walking skeleton is wrong. 

The walking skeleton also doesn't really make the product a "slightly better working version" as there will technically be no functionality change, so **would creating the walking skeleton not be considered a proper, independent task to be assigned and committed to the `master` branch**? Is it just a separate branch/dummy code that team members should refer to when implementing their feature?

Hi, you probably need to install dos2unix on your laptop. (Not a mac user but I think you can use homebrew to install it)

Assuming your runtest.bat resides in the text-ui-test folder, it would mean that the working directory when you run it is inside the text-ui-test folder. Thus, to access the src folder you need to move one level up, which would mean just changing the filepath to "..\src\main\java\data\list.txt" (just prepend a dot)

I'm guessing that it's most likely because of the multiple creation of the Scanner object in your code, since you are creating a new Scanner every time you call the readCommand function. 

The better practice is to just create one Scanner object and use it for the entirety of the program to read inputs.

Hi if you're using the checkstyle and suppress xmls from ab3, you can change your checkstyle version (in build.gradle as well) to 8.1 and it'll get rid of the 'FileContentsHolder' error.

Sorry, I'm still a little confused about what exactly the skeleton means 😅 

So for example if we were to create a walking skeleton for v1.2, would it be adding all the fields, methods and classes required for the features we are adding for v1.2 into the repo, but leaving the implementation out (returning some default value or doing some default action)? Or would it be something else?

> That's going too low level. 'Components' here means higher level things, not low level things such as fields and methods. For example, if you expect the network communication to be handled by a separate component and there isn't any yet, you can add an empty Network class as a place holder for that component. By the time you are done with v1.2, it could evolve in to a component consisting of a bunch of other internal classes and many methods/fields., but that's later. So, the skeleton referred to here is an architecture-level skeleton.
> Given you are starting off with an existing code base, the skeleton may already be there. Perhaps you only need to do a bit of refactoring (rename a few things), or in rare cases, add a place holder for a new component that you need but not present in the current one.

Hmmmm from the [jackson github](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations) I don't think its only used for reading.

hi @CodyChew I cloned your code and figured out the issue. Try moving/temporarily deleting your `data` folder at your project root and re-run `gradle test`, I think you should be able to debug from there :)

You can refer to the java documentation [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Desktop.html#getDesktop--) and see that the java.awt.HeadlessException is being caused by your Desktop.getDesktop().

This is because the CI workflows run in a headless environment, and the awt Desktop is not supported there. I would probably skip the tests in the CI by wrapping the whole thing in an `if (Desktop.isDesktopSupported())`, since as far as I can see there's no practical workaround that allows you to open files in this headless environment, besides using Runtime exec and tailoring to each OS maybe?

Not sure if anyone else knows of an easy way to circumvent this limitation?

I'm not 100% sure, but it looks like you're on Windows and tried to run the jar file from your WSL CLI. WSL operates in a virtual environment of sorts and does not offer proper GUI support, thus it will be unable to run this GUI application. You need to run the same command in powershell / cmd

I spent four hours solving this problem and found that it failed because not all tasks have been run. I deleted all of tests before so no report was created.

But I feel confused is it necessary to write tests for main code at the same time when I write main class? Or I can write tests after main part is almost done. If so, JavaCI cannot pass because original tests cannot work as long as of original classes is changed. Is it not friendly to a project which is based on modifying other projects.

I'm not sure whether this is a discussion worth having, but I have this small query:

I have integrated JavaFX into my project and now have a fully functional (albeit ugly-looking) GUI. I'm assuming this is the main platform users will be interacting on/with.

Does that mean the part of the code that deals with printing output onto the terminal (i.e. how we've been interacting with the user prior) is now rendered obsolete? Should I remove it to prevent unncessary bloat in my code?

The only purpose I see in keeping it right now is the fact that if I remove it, it'd be hard to do semi-automated testing using the provided `.bat`/`.sh` file, but I think unit testing using JUnit seems far more efficient as a form of automated testing.

Could anyone shed some light on this? Any comments would be appreciated!

I had a lot of trouble with getting my `.bat` file to work as well, and this is what worked for me:

If you're like me and have a very long and convoluted file path (with lots of whitespaces) to your source files, you can try using the following method:

`SET MY_PATH=&gt;your_really_long_path_here>`

Hereafter you can refer to your path by simply calling `%MY_PATH%` wherever you need it.

Here's an example of what I'm talking about:

Regarding this line:
`SET MY_PATH="my_file_location"`

Did you encase your location path in double quotes (")? If you did, try removing the double quotes. 

i.e. Suppose my path is something like `C:\Users\blah\CS2103\ip`. Then that line would be:
`SET MY_PATH=C:\Users\blah\CS2103\ip`

The former (I just tried) gave me a similar error in your post while the latter worked just fine.

Second issue regarding the `.bat` not working properly:

I'm not sure where your respective directories are but here's what you should be inputting for each command `javac` and `java`:

```
javac -cp <your_source_code_directory> Xlint:none -d <destination_directory> <file(s)_to_compile>
```

`-cp <your_source_code_directory>`: (classpath) your `.java` files should be in this specified directory.
`-d <destination_directory>`: (destination directory) where your `.java` files will end up in after compilation (as `.class` files).

```
java -classpath <your_source_code_directory> <file_to_run> < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT
```

`classpath <your_source_code_directory>`: note this should match the directory where your `.class` files ended up after compilation.

As a reference here is what my `.bat` file looks like atm:

You can try the following: 
```
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\*.java
```

But iirc if you compile your top-level class first (in terms of dependencies) every other relevant class should be compiled as well. Hence why calling `javac` on just `Duke.java` works for me

It should be in the parent directory of `src`, so in your case that would be in `ip`.

To clarify: `..` means navigate to parent directory. So if your current directory is something like `C:\Users\blah\text-ui-test`, a script inside calling for the path `..\src` implies `C:\Users\blah\src`. (`blah` is the parent directory here)

Can you elaborate (and maybe provide an example) of case 2? Not sure I fully understand it.

Nevertheless, to emphasize the notion of encapsulation, what I personally did was create a separate exception class that handles logic specific to an empty todo (or any other task for that matter) description (aptly named `DukeInvalidTaskDescriptionException`). This class extends from `DukeException`. 

By doing so I ensure that neither `Task` nor any exceptions related to the class (or its subclasses) know about each other (because imo they shouldn't). All of the logic with respect to exception handling would then be handled by the overarching driver class (`Duke` by default). This includes throwing the relevant exceptions in try-catch blocks, etc.

I faced a similar issue previously.

I solved it by placing my scanner object as a field within the `Ui` class so that way I only have one scanner object per Ui object (as @qwoprocks has kindly suggested). Thereafter your `readCommand` body can just look something like this:

```
    public String readCommand() {
        return scanner.nextLine();
    }
```

If by testing you mean continuing to use `.bat` or `.sh` files to script testing, the way I did it was pretty rudimentary:

I created a feature to support the `"delete all"` user input command. This command (as its name suggests) deletes all existing tasks (if any) in the list of tasks.

All I did afterwards was make sure this command was the first line of my `input.txt`. This allowed the task list to "reset" every time the script is run.

A cool side effect to adding this command is that users of my Duke chatbot will be able to use it in normal circumstances as well (because I think the default implementation of `delete 2`, etc. can be quite clunky especially for substantially big lists).

I'm sure there are more clever ways to go about doing this though.

I can't think of any other way except checking time string against multiple regex, and my regex is pretty bad.

For example here's one:

    Pattern p = Pattern.compile("(?&gt;year>\\d{4})[\\s\\-.](?&gt;month>\\d{1,2})[\\s\\-.](?&gt;day>\\d{1,2})"
            + "[\\s\\-.T](?&gt;hour>\\d{1,2})[\\s\\-.:]?(?&gt;minute>\\d{2})");
    Matcher m = pattern.matcher(timeString);
    m.matches();

`Matcher.group(groupName)` can then be used to access the individual capture groups.
If the pattern cannot be matched then I just store the raw string as time.

It will be great if anyone can share a elegant approach for parsing date and time.

I have learnt in CS2030 that classes are better if they are immutable, so I kept all my classes immutable.

For example, the list object can be immutable if we create a new list using the old list every time.

Is immutability no longer strictly desirable in higher level programming modules?

So the correct way of doing things is to stop using those Unicode characters?

Yes there seems to be some UI problem as well if I set resizable to false. Some UI elements are cut off.

Thank you for your reply.

We want to make a file manager, where the user can tag files and open files using tags.

Since this is no longer related to person. we thought that we should delete everything related to person as well as the unused Command and Parser, before working on our implementations of Tag class, commands and parsers. We will need to delete all the relevant tests as well.

Is this the right way? Or should we modify AB3 gradually?

Yes the platform is desktop supported.
I think the main issue is because JavaFX's thread is blocked by `Desktop.getDesktop().open()`.
A walk-around that my team used was to run `Desktop.getDesktop().open()` on a separate thread.

```
new Thread(() -> {
   try {
      Desktop.getDesktop().open(file);

Edit: Never mind, `5.1.0` does seem to be available in the [Gradle plugin repo](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.github.johnrengelman.shadow/5.1.0). It might help to show your `build.gradle` file, as well as the output when running with `--stacktrace`.

I'm able to clone @yuming7144's repo, checkout the branch with Gradle and get it working on my end. After getting her to try some things out on her end, I'm fairly certain it's a network issue (as opposed to some error in config or setting up). Anyone have any other suggestions?

This is due to the IntelliJ console picking out `ERROR:` as a keyword and thus showing the supposed error in another window.

> Approved. Keep us posted if the plugin works out. We might want to adopt it for AB3. The plantUML support is especially interesting.

GitHub Pages runs in `safe` mode and only allows the following [whitelisted dependencies](https://pages.github.com/versions/). As such, I'm planning on adding a CI job to build the site without having to adhere to the `safe` mode restrictions, and then pushing the generated static files to a separate branch which will then be deployed.

I'm not sure whether I have to seek permission if I use pre-configured GitHub Actions, but [this](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jekyll-deploy-action) seems to do exactly what I want. If permission is required, I can open a new issue for it.

As for AB3 adoption, I think it wouldn't be too big a concern as long as the teaching team adds the necessary GitHub workflows to support whatever was described above in the base repo, since this proposed GitHub Pages deployment process is rather involved.

@damithc Hi Prof, just a quick update. We didn't end up using that GitHub Action as it only works with personal access tokens, and not the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret that is automatically generated for every repository. It felt wrong to have to use personal access tokens for a team repo.

Also, it turns out that the `github-pages` gem handles a lot of things in the background, such as setting the name of the repo as the base URL. If anyone else is planning on doing this, do keep in mind that there will be a lot of troubleshooting involved. This was the GitHub workflow that we came up with: https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-jekyll.yml.

> If we were to adopt it, it will be for future semesters, not this one. Let's see how it goes for your team. We can decide at the end of the semester.

As for whether it was worth all the trouble, we'll get back to you at the end of the semester. 😄

> What sort of path syntax is this?

This is a refspec; a mapping of references between a remote and a local repository.

> does anyone know what does the `fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*` mean? can't really seem to find much on google... I assume it means something like fetch all head refs + and all refs in remote/origin.

Fetch all references under `refs/heads` from the remote repository and map them to `refs/remotes/origin` in the local repository. The `+` allows for the references to be updated even if it isn't a fast-forward (such as when the commit history is rewritten).

I've taken a few examples out of your failing CI:

```
ERROR:../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/RemarkCommand.java:98: no newline at EOF.
```
This means that your `RemarkCommand.java` file does not have a newline at the end of file. To resolve this, simply add an empty line at the bottom of the file.

```
ERROR:../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java:54: trailing whitespace.
```
This means that at line 54 of your `Person.java` file, you have extra whitespace. To resolve this, delete off the additional whitespace at the end of the line. You can see the additional whitespace if you select it.

Hi, change line 23 in `UiManager.java` to
```
private static final String ICON_APPLICATION = "/images/salon_icon.png";
```

I suspect that different OSes have different load orders. Due to the icon being set both via `MainWindow.fxml` and programmatically in `UiManager.java`, you end up with different icons on different OSes.

I also encountered this problem when I ran runtest.bat on windows. As mentioned on the CS2103 website, "The likely cause that the line endings are different (not visible to the naked eye) because the two files were created in two different operating systems."

Yeah, you didn't give enough information... I guess the reason you can't pull/push is that the branch you click doesn't exist? Or some sync problems...
So I suggest you fetch your code from your Github ip repository first, then try the easiest pull/push operations.

> Looking at your repository, the file is still `Todo.java`. This may be caused by a case-insensitive filesystem like Windows / MacOS. You can try changing the file name to something different, staging it, then changing it to the correct filename `Todo.java` -> `Foo.java` -> `ToDo.java`. Alternatively, there are some steps outlined here that may help.

Hello, I created a team pull request to merge my master branch to the master branch of our team repository on Tuesday. However, it seems that the pull request is not detected by the script, because the individual progress dashboard shows that v1.2 PRs is not present.

I noticed that the dashboard was last updated on October 7, which is after I created and closed the pull request.

I am wondering whether this is caused by the fact that I closed the pull request before the script was run.

Can I ask what I should do?

The question mark will be displayed instead of the check and cross.

Hello, I want to ask several questions regarding the project. 

Firstly, do we need to keep the name of the chatbot, the greeting message, the format of the command, indentation, and response information exactly the same as the ones shown in the example? For example, can I show a different greeting message when the program runs? If a difference between the individual project and the example is allowed, will this difference affect the grading of the project?

Secondly, will the grading be based on the tags, or the commits in master branch, or both?

Thirdly, does the order of commits matter? For example, if I push the commit for level 6 first, and then I push the commit for level 5, will this cause any issues in the grading process?

Sorry but I seem to have quite a few questions to ask. I hope this will not disturb you.

Yeah I do think it will generate the conflict when the marker is added manually. By the way, git also has a default merge tool that can help to resolve merge conflict. To resolve a merge conflict, type

Hi all,

I found these two links which I found to be immensely helpful when altering DarkTheme.css to suit a new theme. Hopefully, this will save you some time when coming up with a new design.  

https://www.schemecolor.com
https://coolors.co/ 

In general: try to keep to the 70-20-10% rule when using new colors so that everything blends nicely together. E.g. Use 70% of a primary color (for your base), 20% of a secondary color (for your features), and 10% of your last color for the accents (alerts/outlines/extras). 

I hope this will save you some time when porting over to a new design

Hi guys,

I am having some issues unique to me (my group members don't have this issue). My text seems to get compressed if it's too long.

Hi, 

If you are trying to do level A-Gradle, I suggest reusing your code from A-JUnit to ensure everything is working correctly. I actually did gradle first instead of the JUnit level so I understand how frustrating it can be. 

If you had followed the non-gradle instructions from JUnit, then you can simply use that code to "test" that you have done A-Gradle first. Remember to create your build.gradle first (and intellij will automatically detect you are trying to install gradle). Below is a screenshot to show you how your setup should look like : 

On your left, make sure your test files are in the right directory (root>src>test>java).  Note the build.gradle file in the directory.
On the right, you can see the gradle toolbar. You can click the little elephant then type in "gradle test" and press enter
At the bottom is the gradle terminal after a successful test

Apparently my script isnt creating an ACTUAL.TXT file. I am not sure what is the issue. If anyone could help me that would be great (:

Hi prof @damithc ,

The dashboard has been updated to the 23rd of September (it was 22nd September when I posted this). 

I noticed some issues with the tracking 

1. According to the dashboard, my team has not created a milestone called v1.1. However, if we look at the dashboard for individual tasks (A0184257X), it says that I have authored and merged a PR in milestone v1.1 which indicates that milestone v1.1 exists. 

2. It also says that I had not done "v1.1 tasks" even though I had done it in the individual task "v1.1 PRs". I provided a link to an issue I had completed down below.
 
3. Our UG had also been completed, link below.

2. Press the + sign and browse for a checkstyle file.
3. From there open `tP > config > checkstyle > checkstyle.xml`
4. Name the checkstyle anything you wish eg. _checkstyle_is_a_2_MC_mod_

5. For scan scope, select `Only Java sources (including tests) `

6. Click `apply` and `ok`

7. Close the settings menu and click the checkstyle tab at the bottom:

I was refactoring Address to ProjectDescription, and inadvertently changed a lot of files unintentionally. Among those changed were some 'seedu.address...' changed to 'seedu.ProjectDescription'. 

In the process of refactoring, I encountered many of these issues and subsequently fixed them. 

However, I face one last issue now. The 'validFile.fxml' and 'validFileWithFxRoot.fxml' have an import statement as seen below:

'&gt;?import seedu.projectDescription.ui.TestFxmlObject?>
&gt;TestFxmlObject xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1" fx:id="validFileRoot">Hello World!&gt;/TestFxmlObject>'


I tried looking line by line for any other accidental change, even going over to Github and combing over every change line by line, However, I cannot seem to solve this error.

Since the issue arises when building, I realised this file is created from elsewhere in the code, and once I find that file I can change it and solve this issue

I would like to implore any kind soul who has gotten this far in my issue to please point me in the right direction. I have spent plenty of time on this issue and would like to resolve it as soon as possible.

The issue was that I did not know where the file was being generated by when the program builds. The fxml files are in fact copied from `test\resources`. SO once I changed those files, the files generated in Build worked too (since they are simply copied over on build)

I should think that the `A` class could have another dedicated method like `getItemStringVal()`. 

Though on balance, it may be impractical to implement that especially if there are many such method calls for a lot of attributes. So maybe this is the ideal way to do it since it would eliminate the need for potentially double the methods in the `A` class.

I'd guess that the right call here is to simply be consistent with either path chosen while considering the architecture of the over all program.

I think we can use both! 

For example, when the parent method calls the child method, pass the string to the child method as an argument. In this way, the child method can throw an exception to be caught by the parent method, which can then do the exception handling, e.g. print out the "todo bad" message. Then we don't need to terminate the programme but still manage to use exceptions.

It seems that for case 1, throwing exceptions in constructors isn't a bad practice. In a way, throwing an error as early as possible can be useful as culprit is in the callstack and provide and explanation of the reason (prefer compile-time error to runtime error).

Hi Luoyi, personally I feel that asserting two conditions that will always be true has no significance. I quote the textbook [W5.6] **_Assertions are used to define assumptions about the program state so that the runtime can verify them._** .

Since there will be no change in the boolean values of your conditions in both compile time and runtime, then it does not fit the purpose of using Assert. I would suggest you to write in comments above the code for readers to take note of such condition.

I compared your codebase and the file, it looks quite different from mine. Your ui and task package are together with your duke, whereas my ui and task packages are inside duke. You might want to try `gradle clean shadowJar` instead.

Hi Matthias, I feel that it is fine for `Parser` to be an interface because it provides a "contract" that promises what a `Parser` can do. It specifies what methods a `Parser` object should have!

As for `Command`... I am not too sure as it currently does have any class fields. Well I guess maybe for the extensibility of the `Command` class, where you may add properties to it? Let's say you define a constructor that takes in some primitives or objects as class fields in your addressbook.

Hope I'm making sense!

The problem lies in the line `: String.format("%d.%s\n", i + 1, tasks.get(i).toString());` in your convertTaskListToString method.
Since your clearly state out that the end line is \n instead of System.lineSeparator(), the correct listMessage string should be:
```
String listMessage = "Here are the tasks in your list:\n" +  
                "1.[T][" + CROSS_ICON + "] t1\n"  +
                "2.[D][" + TICK_ICON + "] t2 (by: Aug 24 2020, 10:00)\n" +
                "3.[D][" + CROSS_ICON + "] t3 (by: Aug 27 2020, 11:00)\n" + 
                "4.[E][" + TICK_ICON + "] t4 (at: Aug 24 2020, 11:00)\n" + 
                "5.[E][" + CROSS_ICON + "] t5 (at: Aug 27 2020, 12:00)";
```

Only use `System.lineSeparator()` to represent line breaks that use `System.out.println()` or strings that clearly refer to `System.lineSeparator()` themselves.

I suppose this is what you are facing, where the checkstyle gives warning about the parenthesis on the start of a new line. If so, you can use these comments to temporarily turn off those checkstyle. Hope this helps

Could be due to the Image(getClass.getAsResource.xxxxxx). Remove this and see if the code launches? The exception is caused by a null pointer exception. So the cause is deeper into the stack trace. This is the best I can deduce without the stack trace.

What you said is most likely the cause The invocation target exception can be solved by resolving the null pointer. So maybe somewhere in your code you are accessing an absent resource?

This looks like a similar problem as "javac not recognized...", did you previously have this error? if not i think it has something to do with the environment path. 
You can check if you get the same error in your command prompt by typing the FC command. then you would have to edit your path system variables under environment variables.

Anyone one has faced this issue before? Or can we also move away from standard output and shift our testing to only JUnit tests for our classes. Or is the standard output still important for testing because now my Duke UI is only printing standard output for this .bat test. Appreciate any advice.

Have you tried changing the version of javafx to 11.0.2 in the build.gradle file? According to the [bug tracker for javafx](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8211304) the fix has been backported to version 11.0.2, but I am not able to test since I'm on Windows.
This version upgrade doesn't require a newer version of JDK.

I think I ran into a similar problem when copy pasting the code for the 4th tutorial. Have you placed the copy pasted code into a package? If so, go through the fxml files and make sure that all class names mentioned in those files have the proper naming for them, with the package name included.

I guess my method might cause our build.gradle to deviate from the rest of the cohort? I'm not sure what downsides this will have, but I suspect its not very relevant because there's already people modifying their build.gradle to use external libraries and such.

About Adithya's method, I personally havent tried it myself so I'm not 100% sure, but I suspect you'll have to edit the .fxml file to change the version string every time you edit something in it with the scene builder. I don't have experience with this though so it would be nice if someone who did that could test it for me.

I had the same problem and I got a response from the prof in the gitter chat. The PR from your fork needs to be from a branch other than `master`. The reasoning was that the forking workflow needs each PR to the upstream repo to be from a different fork, and having all PRs from the `master` branch prevents each member from making more than one PR.

actually IMO the whole concept of immutability in java is kinda pointless because it does not have "const-correctness" like other languages. Just because your `taskList` is marked `private final`, it doesn't mean the list *itself* is immutable, only that the reference to the list is immutable.

you can't reassign the list to another new list, but you are totally free to append/delete items to/from the list. in fact, having a getter allows other people to do `list.getTasks().clear()` or something else to modify the list.

in general you should not treat what you learn in programming modules as dogmata (eg: cs2030 said immutable classes are good, so i should always use them) (eg: cs2103 said we should program in OOP style, so i should always program in OOP), but weigh their pros and cons as you deem fit. for example, if you know that your list is gonna have hundreds or thousands of items, then it doesn't make sense to die-die make your class immutable and force a copy every time you want to modify something.

(nb: even though you're only copying pointers, a copy is still a copy)

on the other hand, if your classes are small, and (imo) generally stored in lists or something like that, you might want to make them immutable, so you can hand out references with ease-of-mind that nobodoy will change things from under your feet. good examples here might include your various `Task` classes.

anyway this problem is unique to java because of its lousy concept (or lack thereof) of "const-ness", as mentioned before. in a more sensible language you'd be able to create and pass around const references so the idea of having an "immutable class" wouldn't make sense.

Personally I did both!
Basically it's encased in a try catch block. 

The try block tries a static method I declared in the Duke.java file

The catch block will catch my custom exception and inside my catch block is simply a 
sys.out.println(e.getmessage())

This will allow the program to keep running while printing the error msg and having the method throw an exception

The issue is with the load method of the FXMLLoader, but I can't seem to find out why this is happening only when I try to run the program in its JAR form. I tried opening jar file as an archive and noticed that the resources folder is not there:

I used the File, FileWriter and Scanner classes to read and write the text file for level 7. For some reason, there were no issues when i compile and run the program in the console but when i used runtest.bat, an IOexception is triggered: 
```
java.io.IOException: The system cannot find the path specified

The following is a snippet of my code:
```
.....
File savedList = new File("src/main/data/taskList.txt");
            if (!savedList.exists()) {
                 // Create new file if it does not exist.
                savedList.createNewFile(); &gt;--- exception is triggered here.
            }

Is this a problem with the working directory? Because runtest.bat uses the Duke.class file from the bin directory.

Hi Ming Soon,

My Launcher class is not in any package. This is how it looks like:

Thanks Cody and Prof Damith for the comments. I have shifted the JavaFX classes into my duke package.

I don't think the issue is with my MANIFEST.MF file, because that file is auto-generated by Intellij when I set the settings under ```project structure -> artifacts```. Although my project has more than one psvm main() method, I made sure to select the Launcher class when building the JAR file.

Could my build.gradle be missing something / is configured wrongly?

@damithc 
My bad, I was trying to build the JAR file using intellij's build artifacts function instead of Gradle. This resolves the issue.

On a side note, I tried running the generated shadowjar and got an FXML exception:

Hi Ming Soon, my mainClassName is also set to duke.Launcher and my dependencies in gradle are the same. Seems like the core issue is related to these 2 lines of code:
```
FXMLLoader fxmlLoader = new FXMLLoader(Main.class.getResource("/view/MainWindow.fxml"));

AnchorPane ap = fxmlLoader.load();
```

There are no issues while running the project in Intellij and only when it is being run as a JAR file.

I had the same issue. Check your java version on your other computer and update it if it is outdated. If that still doesn't work, check the windows PATH and environment variables to see if windows is pointing to the correct java executable (there might more than 1 version of java installed on that computer).

Issue solved. The problem was that getResource() returns null, causing FXMLLoader's load method to fail. Turns out that my 'view' folder under 'resources' was capitalized to 'View', and that was causing the issue.

But I think it's weird how my program works in Intellij despite this misspelling however, as though it corrects it automatically.

The problem I think it is because of your format of setting MY_PATH, just like others said. 
Instead of setting PATH, have you tried to use the .., which means go to the parent directory? i.e. `javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\*.java`

Hi,

My team is working on a flashcard application. Currently, we have planned the milestone tasks such that milestone v1.2 mainly involves simple CRUD operations, where flashcard is essentially the same entity as person but with extra fields removed. Because milestone v1.2 resembles much of the existing functionality in AB3, most of our work is removing unnecessary fields and renaming classes. May I ask if this is sufficient for v1.2 to be considered completed, or do we have to start implementing tasks in milestone v1.3 (which contains new functionality for my team)?

Hi,
I am currently using Intellij Idea 2019.3.1 (community edition) on Windows Java 11. I am currently failing 5 test cases for the add command tutorial, which is affecting my Gradle build. The error messages are similar, but I do not understand why I am getting these errors because when I check the files that I changed in SourceTree, I can see that I did not change the code relevant to the error messages. 
![Screenshot (295)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69441240/94824480-a7ceea80-0437-11eb-836b-4ff5307f92ac.png)

I think the error messages are similar because they indicate that the memory locations of the two Addressbook/AddCommand objects are different. The other error messages are similar so I never show them here. However, I am still confused as to why these errors are happening. May I have some advice as to where I am going wrong?

I have resolved the issue by removing the problematic lines of code. However, I am still a bit confused about why this problem pops up.
So previously I wrote this in the Person class:

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object other) {
        if (other == this) {
            return true;
        }

        if (!(other instanceof Person)) {
            return false;
        }

        Person otherPerson = (Person) other;
        return otherPerson.getName().equals(getName())
                && otherPerson.getPhone().equals(getPhone())
                && otherPerson.getEmail().equals(getEmail())
                && otherPerson.getAddress().equals(getAddress())
                && otherPerson.getTags().equals(getTags())
                && otherPerson.getRemark().equals(getRemark());
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        // use this method for custom fields hashing instead of implementing your own
        return Objects.hash(name, phone, email, address, tags, remark);
    }
So the lines of code that I removed to make it work are && otherPerson.getRemark().equals(getRemark()), and I modified Objects.hash to exclude the remark field.

Clearly, I added the remark field to the object hash, and I also used it as a criterion for determining whether two objects are equal. But why is it that doing this will cause two objects to not be equal? May I have some advice about this? Thanks!

Oh, I understand what you mean, when I went back and added the remark to the hash and also the equals method, then I tweaked the test cases to have all the same default remark, the test cases passed.

Like the other users already mentioned, I do think throwing errors as early as possible would be better.

That said, you could look into having a private constructor and having a factory method to create instances of the class which would have checks before creating the object and thus, avoiding the problems with memory usage etc.

You could even look into other design patterns if you think this might not be proper encapsulation of Task's duties. There is a factory design pattern that seems useful and I've been reading up on.

I'm not sure if there's a proper solution to having two relative paths from different working directories point to the same one but you could create the directories to get the path you want if it isn't found.

When you normally run your program, IntelliJ runs it from the root directory and thus the `src/main/data/taskList.txt` exists.

When you use runtest.bat, the working directory is currently in `text-ui-test` and it cannot find the path `text-ui-test/src/main/data/taskList.txt`.

Another point I would like to add on is that when using lambdas in streams, local variables need to be **final** or **effectively final**. I wanted to introduce streams into my code as well and felt that some workarounds for this tend to make code less readable. For example, a common workaround is using a **final** array to store a single variable that tricks the compiler into thinking that the variable is not modified. This could, however, lead to unpredictable results as detailed in this blog post here https://www.baeldung.com/java-lambda-effectively-final-local-variables

> The restriction to effectively final variables prohibits access to dynamically-changing local variables, whose capture would likely introduce concurrency problems.

So if you find yourself needing to introduce such "anti-patterns" into your code, you should probably not use streams for that portion.

Looking at your repository, the file is still `Todo.java`. This may be caused by a case-insensitive filesystem like Windows / MacOS. You can try changing the file name to something different, staging it, then changing it to the correct filename `Todo.java` -> `Foo.java` -> `ToDo.java`. Alternatively, there are some steps outlined here that may help.

According to the textbook,
> **A composition is an association that represents a strong _whole-part_ relationship.** When the _whole_ is destroyed, _parts_ are destroyed too i.e., the _part_ should not exist without being attached to a _whole_.

In AB3, the relationship between the `Person` class and its components is considered a composition as shown in the diagram below:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52755148/98378097-8d181300-2080-11eb-8c94-34c637434a03.png)

However, as we have found by tracing the execution path that one time, calling the add command creates the parts (using the `ParserUtil` methods) before the `Person` itself. Additionally, when we call the edit command, a new `Person` is created using the same containees from the previous `Person` object, and those containees continue to exist despite the old `Person` record being deleted. Is this still considered a composition in that case?

Hi everyone I just wanna ask about a question that I have encountered while doing the IP.

So what im doing here is typecasting the returned task to Deadlines because only my Deadlines and Events class got a returnTime() method. However, one of my teammates told me that a better way would be to have a returnTime() in the superclass Task, and then throw an exception in the returnTime() method of the Todos class. He claims that this saves code duplication which can be seen from the two cases above (can be combined into one in his method) and also allows for extension should there be more timed Tasks as well as removing typecasting (bad-coding habit). However, I was thinking that having a returnTime() method in Task breaks the polymorphism/inheritance law of including a method in the super class where one/some of the child do not use that method.


In this regard, which would be the better option?

My personal takeaway is (Do correct me if I'm wrong):    
- We should use assertions on private methods, to check if the else/default of a conditional statement is not reached (If it is not supposed to) 
- Generally, we should not use assertions for public methods and definitely not for plausible user input failures

Found this online, hope it helps :)

Where to use Assertions

Arguments to private methods. Private arguments are provided by developer’s code only and developer may want to check his/her assumptions about arguments.
Conditional cases.
Conditions at the beginning of any method.


Where not to use Assertions

Assertions should not be used to replace error messages
Assertions should not be used to check arguments in the public methods as they may be provided by user. Error handling should be used to handle errors provided by user.
Assertions should not be used on command line arguments.

Within a constructor, you can call other constructors of the class directly by using their corresponding signature.

Actually, I think you can just retag the appropriate commit. For me, I think of tags as a pointer and if it points to a commit that does not exist on main branch, you just have to manually change the tag to point to the correct one. (the correct one shd exist on the main branch) 

This can be done by deleting the tag and creating a new tag. After that you can force push just the changed tag to update the remote github tag

Hi, I took a look at your codebase and I think that for `JsonSerializableFinanceAccount`, the constructor should take in a `ReadOnlyFinanceRecord` instead of `FinanceRecord`. 

A `FinanceRecord` has an `ObservableList`, while the interface just has the method.

I'm not really sure how Jackson reads the JSON object, but I think it is attempting to find an `ObservableList` due to the parameter type in that constructor.

Not sure if this might help fix your issue, but you can try playing around with the `VGrow` properties (setting it to `always` for contents that should always increase in vertical height to max height, for example, your list of tasks)

Alternatively, you can directly put a `VBox` into the `ScrollPane` (if its the only item in your `ScrollPane`)

> This first error message usually occurs when you create the scanner object inside the loop. Instead, it should be created once (as a static variable) and reused for each loop. If not, the first scanner object will swallow all the lines from the input.txt and the subsequent scanner objects errors out with the error in your screenshot. That's why I wanted to see the code to confirm if that's the case.

In that case, Windows cannot locate the FC.exe anymore because Windows uses the path variable to locate exe files.

[RESOLVED] %SystemRoot%\system32 was missing from PATH in environment variables thus windows cannot call fc.exe

I think another way to work around to wrap the class around Optional. So the time variable will return Optioanl.empty. With that you can do it with one if statement.

Alternatively, you can implement a general toSaveFormat() in Task interface/abstract class, then Override it in either TimedTask (if you decide to have another layer) or in both Deadline and Event.

Hope this help.

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: Appropriateness of top-level static class**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/98" expanded>

The question is simple: would it be appropriate (in the context of this project) to have a "static" class?
I define a "static" class in the following manner, since top level classes can't be static by definition: 
* Only the default constructor is used, i.e. not declared
* All methods are static

Take for example the Parser class (talked in A-MoreOOP last week). I do not see a reason to make the class not "static" for the following reasons:
1. The default constructor will work fine (I do not need to pass anything, there are no instance variables)
2. For every single method, there would not be a difference in behavior if I:
a) Make the class non-"static" and instantiate it (e.g. `Parser parser = new Parser();` followed by `parser.parseCommand();`)
b) Make the class "static",  and use the class (e.g. `Parser.parseCommand();`)

And this introduces several advantages, without any apparent disadvantages that I can see directly:
1. There is no need to pass by reference if you need it - it's available for every single class to use
2. Save a little bit of space in coding since you do not need to instantiate it

If I'm not mistaken, an exception would cause the program to terminate. Is there any way to throw an exception without exiting the program?

For context, I have the following pseudocode:
```
while (true) {
    wait for input
    receive input
    try {
        do something with input (e.g. todo, bye, etc.)
    } catch (Exception e) {
        print stack trace
    }
}
```

But this would exit the program given an illegal input.

What is the inherent advantage of using inheritance instead of, let's say, enums for the type of tasks in Level 4? As I see it, using inheritance introduces certain inflexibilities (e.g. having a need to add new classes to create any further type of task) as compared to enums. Additionally, enums might have some advantages in pattern-matching (although Java being Java...)

<panel  header="**3. :fas-info-circle: Question About Immutability of Class**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/69" expanded>

Regarding the convention described in the code standard, there is nothing say about immutability. 

As we know, immutability can support method chain for testing, so when is a good practice to have an immutable class?

Here is one concrete example of the testing:

- Here is my taskList class which is mutable:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54443474/91060454-8cfd9f00-e65d-11ea-96d2-45dd8b30e07c.png)

I did not make my arraylist as private final. If I want to make it private final, I need to make my method markDone(),add,delete... etc return a TaskList object. 

Now my testing is like this: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54443474/91060708-dcdc6600-e65d-11ea-8280-7d3a945d05bf.png)

If I make the TaskList and Task immutable and declare a getter function for specific index of TaskList, it is easier for testing. We can just use:

 `AssetEquals(sample.markAsDone().getStatus(), list.add(sampleInList).markDone(0).get(0).getStatus())`

after instantiating three objects to test the output.

So the main point is, when should we have an immutable class?

> actually IMO the whole concept of immutability in java is kinda pointless because it does not have "const-correctness" like other languages. Just because your `taskList` is marked `private final`, it doesn't mean the list _itself_ is immutable, only that the reference to the list is immutable.
> 
> you can't reassign the list to another new list, but you are totally free to append/delete items to/from the list. in fact, having a getter allows other people to do `list.getTasks().clear()` or something else to modify the list.

Oh yeah. If it is really immutable, I should not have the getter method, since all class are passing by reference. But there is a possibility to always use the clone() method to clone the list and pass it out. Because my usage of the getter is just to see the content, it's kind of force the use of the getter method is only to see the content because modifier on this list after cloning is kind of useless (because it will not change the object itself). But I just feel like this is not a good practice considering the efficiency.

Hi, so I have push and completed all the levels and increments and push them to the Github, but some of them are not being marked as done. For example, both my merge level 8 and merge level 9 are being being marked as done despite it being completed. But later levels are being marked as completed, so I am not sure if its become I did it wrongly. Anyone can help? Thanks!

So based on what I know, generally it is safer to us immutability. I understand that using mutable objects are easy to work with and use, the benefit of using immutable objects is the reduction of side effects. I'm sure you have seen first hand the possible side effects of using mutable objects. Immutable objects are more troublesome to use, but it allows you to add-on future areas without having to worry about the side effects it may cause your existing functions. But having said that, I'm currently not using immutable objects as well purely due to it being more troublesome to work with and due to time constraints hahah.

After consulting with prof, this is what I understand:
1. We should not be starting on a clean slate and copying the relevant codes into the new slate.
2. We should keep our new morphed idea as close to the AB3 as possible, it shouldn't be too different from the code provided.
3. Do not make too much deletions of the current legacy code.

For those who have broken any of these rules, you should start to get back on the brown field track asap.

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: Throwing checked exceptions in constructors**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/24" expanded>

Is the throwing of checked exceptions in constructors considered poor practice in software design?

For illustration, consider a checked exception called `DukeException`, a class called `Task` and the scenario of say, writing a command "todo" without any description.  

**Case 1:** The `Task` constructor throws a `DukeException` on being passed a `null` string as description. 
The benefit (per my understanding) is that it localizes exception logic to the `Task` class. However, this would imply that any user of the `Task` class must always wrap object creation in a `try-catch` block (not sure if this is problematic).

**Case 2:**  The user creating `Task` objects raises a `DukeException` for a null string before calling the `Task` constructor. A benefit is that it avoids problems with object initialization, creation or memory usage. However, this might lead to duplication of code (for example, if neither `Todos`, `Events` or `Deadlines` (which are all `Tasks`) are permitted to have empty descriptions). 

Could someone throw some light on my dilemma (or possible point out flaws in my reasoning?). Thanks in advance!

Building off OP's question (note sure if this is tangential), in the case where we do indeed pick an arbitrary non-boundary value, does it help by picking the most likely option? In other words, if I know that a particular option is most liable to be selected by the user, and I use that option as my "arbitrary" value?

I noticed a (small) number of people having the issue as I had following the instructions from the Week 5. The issue being that when we followed the instructions in the for the merging of Pull Request (PR), the PR was instead made to the nus-cs2103-AY20221S1 fork instead of our own master branch.

I will just do up a short guide to aid others alongside what is given in the iP instructions to aid those not as well versed with github (as I am).

The assumption so far is that you are able to push the branch to your fork in github. I will continue the steps thereafter from the assumption.

1. Go to your iP Repository

2. Go to the branch that you want to create the PR from. (e.g click on branch-A-Lambdas)

3. Click on the pull request once the branch page is loaded.

5. This is where the mistake happens for some people (notice that the merge is suggested to the base repository that is nus-cs2103-AY2021/ip).

6. Click on the nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/ip and the pop up will appear for you to select the right ip to create the right PR.

From here you can then proceed to create the pull request, the interface thereafter from here is rather intuitive, hence, I will only cover up to this point. Feel free to ask questions if you encounter further errors!

Hey bro!

Can I check if you put the Launcher class in the package / folder? e.g if your package name is `duke ` then you should have it as follows. 
In my case, the package of which my Launcher lies in is in the package `duke`.

```
application {
    mainClassName = "duke.Launcher"

```

Hello! For this I realised the issue was in `build.gradle` under my `main application`. I resolved it by redirecting my mainClassName with the package name e.g `duke.Launcher`.

I would suspect it might have to the with the package / directory issue given the similarity of the error. But note that I did not encounter the load() error as you did. But I would strongly suggest looking at how you reference the class names or file names.

Also, if your JAR files are not being added inside (as per your suspicions):

Maybe you can check your `dependencies` in `build.gradle` ? Does it contain the JavaFX dependencies as shown below. I also encountered this but realised I carelessly deleted the dependencies as I drowned in gradle.

Hi, thanks for the advice. But when I delete the .idea file and restart the intellij project, it still tells me that zip END header not found. And another issue that arises by deleting .idea and restarting the project is that intellij now cannot run the java files(i.e, the java files are not recognized as runnable). so I am very confused about it..

so I tried to delete the gradle-6.2-bin and run the project in intellij again. But when I entered gradlew --version in the command line, the following error occurred.

And again in intellij it tells me that it cannot import the gradle file and the error message says "Cause: zip END header not found". So I am not sure if clearing gradle cache works. I also tried to reinstall intellij but that couldn't work either.

> @Royxuzeng You can also try using a fresh clone of the ip repo, and go through the steps carefully to step up gradle for it, just to see if the same problem occurs there as well. That will help you determine if the problem is inside your current iP project setup or more systemic to your computer/OS setup.

I tried to use a fresh clone of the ip repo but the same problem occurred so I think the ip does not have problems. When running gradlew --version in the command prompt in the project root folder, the error occurred that it cannot unzip the gradle-6.2-bin.zip so I think it might have something to do with it but I am really not sure how to fix this issue.

Hi Kc, I believe most of the properties in FXML are available in the JavaFX documentation under the properties portion. And most of it follows the notation that we have often use such as setSOMETHING. And SOMETHING would be the FXML properties.

Some examples are 
```
setAlignment  (java) -> alignment (fxml)
setBottomAnchor (java) -> AnchorPane.bottomAnchor (fxml)
```

 In the case where properties are not available, most likely than not, that method you have seen is only available as a method in java such as binding of heights 

Also if you are ok with CSS, you can consider using JavaFX CSS instead. Note that there are some FXML properties that are not available in CSS as well. https://openjfx.io/javadoc/11/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html

You can also look at the CSS properties to convert it to fxml properties like `fx-fill-height` in CSS is equivalent to `fillHeight` in FXML.

To delete a tag, I use `git tag --delete origin tagname`. Just make sure that the tagname does not clash with any branch's name or it will delete the branch as you said. The former method you used is indeed safer and it works for me, but remember to delete to local tag also.

I suppose the runtest script is not linking javafx (3rd party library), thats why it says those classes do not exist.
On a side note, the runtest is to test the text UI, but since you have added GUI, the text is not in standard output anymore which could not be tested by the script. You can use Junit to test methods output though. 
For actuall GUI testing, we need another 3rd party library, maybe Espresso?

I have this error when running from the Main class. The thing is everything runs fine if its initiated from Launcher class. 
Does anyone have the same issue?

My current implementation in Launcher class is this:
'

        Application.launch(Main.class, args);
    }
'

That is because your path will read from where you run the command, meaning running from runtest.bat vs Duke class would have different starting file location. One way to solve this is by doing this:

```
public final static String FILEPATH = System.getProperty("user.dir") + (System.getProperty("user.dir").endsWith("text-ui-test")
        ? "/saved-tasks.txt"
        : "/text-ui-test/saved-tasks.txt");
``` 
This assumes that you put your storage inside text-ui-test, you have to adjust the accordingly depending on where you put your storage file.

Use this FILEPATH as an argument in your FileReader/Writer. Hope this helps!

Are you trying to merge the level branches with master branch? If so, you have to ensure that you are at master branch before pulling other branches. 
Use `git branch` to check the branches available in your code, and use  `git checkout &gt;branch_name>`
to enter the branch.
Once you're at master branch, enter `git merge --no-ff &gt;branch_name>`

Not really sure whats the best way to move forward as I do not know your current github status (since udk too..) but the best bet would be forcing yourself to move to a particular commit. You can check on github with commit code you want to revert your work to, and enter `git reset --hard &gt;commit_id>` or `git reset --hard HEAD`
I think from here onwards, you should be able to push and pull, just take note of the changes you have done before the issue came about.

You can also check https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/77 to see if you have the same issue

In terms of functionality, whether it is interface or abstract class it will work the same way.

However, in my opinion, since Command only have a contract of `public abstract CommandResult execute(Model model) throws CommandException;` where there is no method body, interface would be better suited in this case. 

This however, would change if in the future you want to add more methods that have a method body in Command, hence the need for an abstract class arises as this will reduce the amount of code to be rewritten to those classes that extends Command.

> I think Gradle does not actually know the version, and completely relies on whatever number you put in the build.gradle file. Its just that the structure between checkstyle of version 8.32 and 8.23 is different so if you tell gradle that you are using 8.23 then they will give you an error because the structure seems wrong to them. I only knew the correct version from the commit header too.

> About Adithya's method, I personally havent tried it myself so I'm not 100% sure, but I suspect you'll have to edit the .fxml file to change the version string every time you edit something in it with the scene builder.

In the Week 8 Quiz, there is a question regarding association roles. I initially thought that association labels and association roles are distinct, s.t. only association "roles," and not "labels," may represent the "highlighted association role." Prof Damith clarified the different uses of roles and labels during the lecture, but this concept of "representation" still feels a bit ambiguous to me personally. Since roles and labels are basically describing the same association with a different format, is it correct to say that a diagram depicting an association label represents the highlighted association role?

Hello, what I did was to create the config/checkstyle directory myself. Afterwards, I proceed to add checkstyle.xml and suppressions.xml obtained from the link given in the Checkstyle tutorial [https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle) into the checkstyle directory. The structure of the folders and files is shown below:

Do remember to install the checkstyle plugin and do the relevant configuration mentioned in "Using Checkstyle" guide.

This worked for me, let me know if it works for you as well :) Not too sure if there is another way to go about solving this issue without manually creating the directories and xml files.

Previously I have followed tutorial from https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/jar.html to create a JAR file with Intellij IDEA, and everything worked. When this week I attempted to create a new JAR file, it says "MANIFEST.MF already exists in VFS". 

So I did the following things:
1. delete the whole folder in src/main/java/META-INF
2. delete the old jar file "ip.jar" in out/artifacts/ip-jar
3. follow the tutorial again to try to create a new jar file again

However, it showed "no main manifest attribute, in ip.jar". When I copy & paste the new MANIFEST.MF file into the folder out/artifacts/ip-jar, it showed the same error message as well as the "duke.Duke" is highlighted as red. (I guess it is due to the wrong directory but I try different forms and fail to correct it) (Duke.java is inside the duke package)

The content of MANIFEST.MF is simply:
"Manifest-Version: 1.0 
Main-Class: duke.Duke"

My directory is like this.

Another thing (not related to this issue) I want to bring up is that instructions installing checkstyle plugin using intelliJ may not be updated since the window is slightly different on my computer.

Hi guys, my team and I are trying to modify the GUI such that a panel will contain multiple sections, each with their own list of information.

Our target layout will be a header of the section, followed by cards that encapsulate the info we want to display, for multiple sections. Our target is to be able to scroll across the sections but currently we can only scroll within a section.

We used the stackpane implementation used by the initial GUI, and we got multiple scrollbars on the panel (see right panel on screenshot). Any ideas on how to modify the right panel so that it displays the header, followed by all the cards of the respective section?

Right now, the hierarchy is in the Scenebuilder screenshot:
We wrap everything inside a VBox followed by the headers (Labels) and Stackpanes (ListView). 

Because of the different layouts of the cards and headers, we can’t fit everything inside a stackpane, and i don’t think we’re supposed to do that either ._.”

Current GUI Layout:

To setup Gradle for my project, I created a `build.gradle` file and added these into the file:

```
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'application'
    id 'checkstyle'
    id 'com.github.johnrengelman.shadow' version '5.1.0'
}

test {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.4.0'
    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.4.0'
}
```

These were taken from the [Gradle tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html) and the [JUnit tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html). 

Afterwards, I imported the project using scenario 1 as mentioned in the Gradle tutorial and all seemed to work fine.

However, when I tried to add the annotation `@Test` and imports `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test`, `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals`, `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.fail`, to my test files, I encountered an error and the suggested fix was to add `JUnit5.4` to the class path. However, nothing happened after clicking on it.

I've tried looking at my project settings and under "Libraries", it tells me that the library "Gradle: org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.4.0" "cannot resolve external dependency org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.4.0 because no repositories are defined"

Anyone could help explain how to integrate Gradle and JUnit properly, that would be greatly appreciated.

I assume you are referring to level 7 and level 8. Please correct me if I'm wrong but I believe you just need to push your branches normally. So just `git checkout` the branch you want to push and then just `git push`. This will push the branches to your fork. Then go back to your `master`, and merge the level 7 and level 8 branch. then you commit the merge and tag afterwards. Once done just push your commits and tags from the master branch.

> I have learnt in CS2030 that classes are better if they are immutable, so I kept all my classes immutable.

I don't think classes are necessarily "better" if they are immutable. But it's better in the sense that they allow for more control and helps in debugging.

And so to answer the question:

> Is immutability no longer strictly desirable in higher level programming modules?

I believe it's still desirable as you want to have greater control over your program flow. So, I think a better question to ask would be "do I want my class to be immutable?" (so as to get the benefits from immutability) rather than does this programming module require/desire immutability for my classes.

Someone do correct me if my understanding is wrong.

When we use parallel paths in activity diagrams, does it mean that the corresponding code runs asynchronously or does it just mean that the actions are independent? For e.g let's say there is a method with 3 lines and each of the 3 lines runs the same way regardless of the result of the other 2 lines. However, they are technically executed sequentially in the code. Would it be wrong to represent each of the 3 lines as being done in parallel in the activity diagram?

Here's how to do it:
1. Navigate to Analyze > Run Inspection by Name. A small popup should appear.
2.  In the popup, search for and select "Unused declaration"

When you deleted the Level-5 tag, I think you did not delete it from the remote. Went to take a look at your repo and your Level-5 tag commit hash does not match the one that is shown when you did `git log`  Maybe you can try the following: 

1.  `git tag -d Level-5` -  This will delete the Level-5 tag locally
2.  `git push origin :refs/tags/Level-5` - This will delete the Level-5 tag on the remote. If that doesn't work, try:
`git push --delete origin Level-5`
3.  Create the Level-5 tag at the commit you want again
4. `git push origin refs/tags/Level-5` or `git push origin Level-5` - This will push your local Level-5 tag onto the remote

You can skip 1 and 3 if you are sure there's nothing wrong with your Level-5 tag locally.

I did some basic styling and made the GUI responsive to changes in window size so the GUI window can be maximised!

Personally, I would use streams to make use of `map`, `filter` and `reduce`. These functions are well known and quite commonly used in many other programming languages like javascript or python, hence developers who read your code will find them familiar and easy to understand. Furthermore, you can chain them together. For instance, something like:
```
list.stream()
    .map(x -> x * 2)
    .filter(x -> x < 1000)
    .reduce(0, (a,b) -> a + b)
```
Imo this is very concise, one look and you will know what the intended result is. Doing this without streams, you will need a for loop, some if statements, another variable to keep track of the sum and i think it'll generally be a little harder to understand. 

However, if the logic starts become too complicated to be succinctly expressed in terms of chaining the lambda expressions, then yea I do agree that perhaps it'll be clearer not to use streams.

I think I found the issue. The issue was with the jacoco plugin: I think it was by default using a version that is incompatible with jdk 11. Adding the following into build.gradle to specify the latest version of jacoco solved the problem. 
```
jacoco {
    toolVersion = "0.8.5"
}

I think in that case, for Q52 Week 5 Quiz, it is more suitable if the question is framed as **"Java assertions are used in unit testing"** rather than **"Java assertions are used for unit testing."** ? 

And assert can refer to either Assert.AreEqual in unit tests or assert in functional code so it wasn't stated clearly in the qn?

I am currently attempting the A-Streams increment for iP and I have encountered various instances when I am uncertain on whether I should keep my existing code or change it to utilise streams. This dilemma stems from the fact that the textbook says that we should practice "Keep it simple, stupid" and when I change my code to use streams, it looks more complicated for another reader to understand what is going on. So my question is, is there any guidelines that we can refer to so that we can use streams appropriately and not overuse it?

I think Java assert cannot be used as a form of unit testing because it just checks that the assumption at a certain point in code is correct. It does not verify that the logic of code you have written is entirely correct. Because if your assumption is incorrect then the assertion will be incorrect. Java assert is also used mainly for debugging and improving your code quality.

This is why I think that using java assert is not the best for unit testing. I may be wrong on this but this is my take on why java assert should not be used as a form of unit testing but more so to make sure your assumptions at a certain point in your code is correct.

Only the assert() lines are not highlighted as green, does this mean that the assertions are not detected as my code? I think it is because that someone else in the group make changes after I wrote the code because last week this item was detected as done but not this week. If I use the `author` tags to indicate these lines are actually my code, will the system detect this and mark this item as done (it is now marked as overdue)? Thanks prof!

Hello guys, I have a quick question.

If reviewing PR, and the code has multiples of the same mistake (eg. wrong indent for multiple files), do we flag every single mistake, or just flag one? I'm thinking that if you flag every mistake, it will just make the other member angry at why you are focusing on such minor mistakes.

Not sure whether anyone have the similar issue of unable to generate jar from IntelliJ (like what we did previously) or generate the jar using Gradle but encounter "no manifest attribute error"

I had this issue yesterday and it took me 2 hours to debug

let me share a useful Youtube Video first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwdkyrnJQsg&t=194s

I follows the steps shown in the video and add in jar {xxxx} in my build.gradle as shown in the video

Then I run the following command in the terminal: ./gradlew clean build  

the Jar file should be available in build/lib folder

Then you can run the jar in the terminal using the following command: java -jar [your jar address] 

Take note, there are two jar files and choose the correct one, most people might be duke.jar (I guess) ?

Anyway you can trial and error to see which jar is the correct one

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: Dynamic Subclass Instance returned in Factory Method**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/35" expanded>

Suppose there is a Class `Toy` and there subclasses `BigToy`, `MediumToy` and `SmallToy`. All toys have to be either Big, Medium, or Small. There is a static Factory method `createToy` in Toy that returns an object of the respective subclass depending on the arguments passed to it. Pseudocode: 

```
class Toy {
    Toy createToy(identifier) {
        switch (identifier) {
           case BIG: return new BigToy();
           case MEDIUM: return new MediumToy();
           case SMALL: return new SmallToy();
           default: throw exception;
        }
    }
}
```

This solution to dynamically return a subclass in a factory method, albeit working, is in clear violation of the _Open-Closed Principle_ as there is need to modify/change the factory every time a new Sub-Class is created. Is there a better, more-dynamic solution to the problem of returning the appropriate sub-class object in the super-class factory method?

One solution I can think of is to have a "map" of the identifier to the subclasses and modify that. However, I am unsure as to how the value of this "map" can be made to create an object. Something like: `return new map[identifier];`. Is this solution a valid approach or does it fall prey to the Open-Closed Principle also?

I would like to ask exactly how much freedom do we have with respect to the Individual Project. Is it only limited to the appearance level? Or do we have some freedoms with respect to the actual functionality of the chatbot? For example, let's say that the user enters the command: `todo finish ip /by Thursday 2359`.  Should we interpret it as the description is `"finish ip /by Thursday 2359"` (which is what the current documentation on the website implies)? Or are we allowed to customize it in such a way that it throws an exception as there is an additional parameter?

I am having a strange problem relating the debugger function. I followed the Tutorial : Tracing Code and everything was smooth until I ran debug.main. 
I started by Edit Configuration and I changed the Program arguments as shown:

However, when I go back to check the debugger, it is empty (i.e. Not showing any variable/ steps) and the STEP IN buttons and other buttons are also grey, as shown below:

Thanks to everyone who has taken time to read this issue, I have managed to resolve it with trial and error.

Basically, I resolved this problem of unable to use buttons like STEP IN by changing the way of running the debugger. So, this is a workable route for me : 
1. Set a break point as usual. 
2. Instead of using the top menu Run > Debug, use Gradle at the right side bar to run Debug 'tp[run]'. 
<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2020-09-28 at 10 09 00 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59159857/94443266-896ab400-01d7-11eb-8892-d4fbad7fd55a.png">

Then pass in the argument of 'edit 1 n/Alice Yeoh' through the GUI.
Now go back to the debugger and all steps and variables are shown correctly.

<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2020-09-28 at 10 13 01 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59159857/94443643-fd0cc100-01d7-11eb-93f7-9e594c75f346.png">

Furthermore, after one single run with Gradle, the top bar menu is updated to be the same as what is present in the side bar containing Gradle. From this observation, I suspect the initial problem I encountered is caused by the design of cache of intelliJ, i.e. the project is not properly imported from Gradle and some cache information which should be changed are not changed. However, this is just a very rough feeling in my guts and I have no evidence to support it. (I think I am the only person, but ) if anyone by any change faced the same problem as me, try File > Invalidate Cache/Restart and use Gradle to run the debugger.

Alright thanks Prof. We managed to fixed the issue. I'm just intrigued why the test cases give different results on different OS because our issue was not with the file path.

I will close this issue for now.

It was the use of one of our testUtil classes. One of the test cases added into the new PR modified the testUtil variables which caused the failure of 2 other tests. Though I'm not sure why it only fails in an OS other than Windows.

Hi, for the Automated Text UI Testing for IP week 2, we are required to replace the classpath for the .bat file(on Windows)

From the [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/textUiTesting.html), it mentioned: 

Update the javac and java commands in the script to match the name/location of your main class.
If you are using packages, the two commands need to take the packages into account too.

However, im not sure what javac and java commands that we would have to change. What I did was to change the locations after the ..\bin command to the directory of my java files. But everytime I ran the .bat file, a command prompt window opens and quickly closes. There is no ACTUAL.txt in the same directory as well. 

Thanks for helping :D

```
@ECHO OFF

REM create bin directory if it doesn't exist
if not exist ..\bin mkdir ..\bin

REM delete output from previous run
del ACTUAL.TXT

IF ERRORLEVEL 1 (
    echo ********** BUILD FAILURE **********
    exit /b 1
)
REM no error here, errorlevel == 0

Thanks so much, but right now I realised that I have multiple java files since I have more than 1 class,

So what I did was to just to repeat the javac statement multiple times.
I.e
```
REM compile the code into the bin folder
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\Task.java
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\ToDo.java
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\Deadline.java
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\EventTask.java
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\Duke.java
```
But it is still treated as if Task.java is not compiled, resulting in an error when ToDo tries to extend from Task.java but is unable to find Task.java

May I ask please ask how to then compile multiple java files?

Thanks!

I had this problem because when I was refering to filepaths in my program, I used the full filepath(D://joven//UNI//CS2103... ) for the storage(and even in the javafx libraries to select an image). 
So I solved it by changing the name to a generic filepath. 
Im not sure did this solve the problem on linux since I do not have linux to test my program on, but on a fresh mac and windows, it did work.

If you are running Windows 10, you can make use of a new Windows feature called Windows Sandbox.

_**"Windows Sandbox provides a lightweight desktop environment to safely run applications in isolation. Software installed inside the Windows Sandbox environment remains "sandboxed" and runs separately from the host machine."**_ - From https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview#:~:text=Windows%20Sandbox%20provides%20a%20lightweight,and%20the%20state%20are%20deleted.

If you do not know which version of Windows 10 you have, you can check by going into Settings -> Update & Security -> OS build info (on the right, under related links), then scroll down. You should see something like this:
![Windows 10 Specification](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62177772/93214239-7d263600-f797-11ea-948c-162d8ee0f3ca.png)
(If you are running the Home edition, follow this link:
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/131437-enable-windows-sandbox-feature-windows-10-home-edition.html)

If you are running Pro edition, it's even easier! First, follow the guide below to add Windows Sandbox. 
https://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-windows-sandbox-windows-10-may-2019-update#:~:text=Inside%20the%20Windows%20Sandbox%20experience,application%20files%20using%20Microsoft%20Edge.

After you are done setting up, proceed to install Java SE 11 inside of Windows Sandbox.

After you are done installing, to transfer your .jar file from your main windows to Windows Sandbox, simply **right click and copy (in your main Windows)**, then **right-click and paste (in Windows Sandbox)**.

Try running your .jar file by double-clicking on it. If all works well, you should see your application running inside!

This way, you can isolate any Java issues you have on your main Windows, and try it on a fresh copy of Windows.

Hi, I plan to set up Gradle for my iP, but I have no idea if it is already installed and if it is not I'm rather confused on how to install it. My question is by default which scenario applies to us? 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29449107/91724140-6f858380-ebcf-11ea-9806-351fc0009cd0.png)

Is it scenario 3? I remember seeing "added gradle support" in a previous commit from the repo, does that mean anything?

Any help is appreciated!

For the component named projectDashboard which I want it to be scrollable is placed in the scrollable pane.

I don't see why the stack pane is still not scrollable. I can't even find a solution on how to solve this issue online.

@fall9x It shows the vertical bar now but it is still not able to scroll up and down. @JinHao-L I have set the vgrow of stack pane to be place in the scroll pane and the vgrow of scroll pane to be always.

I solved it by removing the stackpane of my projectDashboard.
<img width="1232" alt="Screenshot 2020-11-06 at 5 03 09 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66521590/98347277-2bd94b00-2052-11eb-8641-7592222d0b40.png">
The height of scrollpane doesn't affect the vertical scroll bar.
<img width="1235" alt="Screenshot 2020-11-06 at 5 03 34 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66521590/98347287-31369580-2052-11eb-85db-eed504aa1fe5.png">
But the stackpane of my dashboard restricts the grow of my vbox. Even though i set the max height of the stack pane to be max_integer but it still doesn't allow the grow of the vbox inside. So i use only the vbox for my project dashboard and set the max height to be max_integer.

The programme runs well on IntelliJ regardless whether I use absolute path or relative path to create new file.

You can also go to where your main iP folder is and create a new folder inside called data. It will appear in intellij, then right click on the new folder in intellij and create a new file (Duke.txt) from there. Hope this helps!

Hello, I think I found the problem! All this while, the wrong directory was marked as the module in my project structure (it was `[project root]` but it should be `[project root]/src/main`). I followed these steps to solve the issue:
1. Remove old `[project root]/src/test` directory as module and delete it
2. Remove `[project root]` directory as module
3. Go to File > New > Module from Existing Sources and choose `[project root]/src/main`, then selecting `Create module from existing sources` followed by all the default settings.
4. Mark `[project root]/src/main/java` as source root if you havent done so
5. Now follow the instructions [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html) again and it should work!

So I was wondering why some of my commits seemed to not have my profile pic then I noticed that the commits made through sourcetree were being attributed to another email of mine. Long story (included below) short, I am trying to correct it but currently facing some difficulty. I am following this [guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2919878/git-rewrite-previous-commit-usernames-and-emails) and it is resulting in duplicated commits. And when I try to preview the PR, it is showing 900+ commits. 

Including this here partly because it was meant to be my initial issue post:
Previously my tp fork was quite messy because I tried to resolve the conflicts arising from the duplicated commits by merging and I made a mistake by mass merging without checking. After quite a bit of searching. I managed to hard revert it back to the commit before all the above were done. 

Would appreciate any help if anyone has been through this or knows a bit more about the process! Thanks!

Thank you @AlexCQY, I had the same issue and the suggested program by prof helped to identify the differences (mine were due to white spaces) that were indeed missed by sight. 

By the way, I would like to ask if there is a solution/need to address the weird characters appearing on the terminal as seen in the screenshot above. It's working fine in the ACTUAL.TXT though.

As I'm wrapping up iP, I tried sending to a few friends the `duke.jar` file to test out the bot. Most of them (coming from non-CS background) do not have java and hence cannot open the program. It feels super strange to request them to install java on their own systems.

I did some digging around and found out that many products now are also bundled with their own JRE so users can run them without native java. However, I have two questions regarding that:

1. How do I do that? I tried launch4J but it didn't really work (I probably did it wrongly)
2. Doesn't this bloat up your program by a lot? `duke.jar` itself is around 11 mb, adding a JRE is like ~100+ mb

In case 2, duplication of code can be mitigated if you have a single method for creating the subclasses of Task.

`public Task createTask(String type, String description) throws DukeException`

Then there will only be a single check for whether description is empty or poorly formatted, which throws exception.
This was how I attempted this issue, hope it provides some clarity.

The official java docs gave some nice concrete examples and reasoning (such as the default clause in switch case blocks, method preconditions and postconditions) where assertions can be used.

1. Add the following code to `build.gradle`:

dependencies {
    String javaFxVersion = '11'

But CheckStyle insists that the left parenthesis '(' of line 117 and 121 should be on previous lines, even though they are parenthesis for lambdas. What do you guys think?

Seems like this is mis-configuration between your jar builder and your packages. Did you package your Duke class under seedu.duke? Because the default jar builder configuration from the gradle support is under that, but I doubt any of us are packaging it under seedu.

<panel  header="**4 :fas-comment:**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/192#issuecomment-689316673" expanded>

However I am not too sure how to go about this without just straight up disabling check for left parenthesis. Because there are legitimate reasons for have '(' on the previous line for function calls (such as line 115). It's just that now CheckStyle cannot differentiate parenthesis for lambda or for function calls. Any idea how I can go about this?

Update:
For those interested, here is the link to the modified CheckStyle file that disables the check for "(" to be at EOL.

https://github.com/duckmoon99/ip/blob/9dc0adeb38ba31ef534917941300b76bc3badc64/config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml

You can check the history of the file to find what exactly changed. I am still a bit iffy with this change but I don't know how we can do better straight disabling the check for "(" since there are cases where that needs to be enforced.

Try to post the error message for the sub process, it will give more info on the error. The error message that you posted will be shown regardless of why checkstyle failed.

put this in your gradle.build so that it compiles in utf8:
tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {

I think Gradle does not actually know the version, and completely relies on whatever number you put in the build.gradle file. Its just that the structure between checkstyle of version 8.32 and 8.23 is different so if you tell gradle that you are using 8.23 then they will give you an error because the structure seems wrong to them. I only knew the correct version from the commit header too.

I think `reading each others' data` refers to (directly) accessing other objects' instance variables, which is widely known as bad practice.

However, for `sending each other messages`, it could refer to method invocation in the case of `Java/C#/C++` (see [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2348069)) which is a more "desirable" method (no pun intended) for objects to interact with other objects (as methods serve as encapsulation of the object's variables).

From 'error: invalid flag: C:\Users\Rui' and the line after, it seems as if 'javac' in 'javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\Duke.java
' in 'runtest.bat' is attempting to use 'C:\Users\Rui' as a flag. And as you correctly pointed out, this is caused by having whitespaces in folder or file names.

I can think of two possible solutions:
1. remove the whitespaces in your file and folder names, or
2. replace 'javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\Duke.java' with 'javac  -cp "..\src" -Xlint:none -d "..\bin ..\src\main\java\Duke.java"' in 'runtest.bat' (line 10). Basically surround all paths with " ". 

Hope this helps! Do let me know if 2 works so I can submit a PR to [the repo](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/ip/blob/master/text-ui-test/runtest.bat) to prevent future occurrences of this issue for anyone else.

Ah I see.

What I meant was double quoting "..\src" and "..\bin" in runtest.bat so that javac can recognize them as file paths rather than options.

As for the disappearing \\, trying double backslash \\\\ rather than single \ backslash for each path in sources.txt might work... if my memory of hosting minecraft servers serves me right 😂 (as each backslash character needs to be escaped within " ") .

We can see from the CI logs that the build process failed because gradle failed to download and install the shadow package. Note that this build process happens one one of github's cloud VMs, and not on your local machine.

To fix this, you can close and reopen the PR, making github restart the CI process.

Note that this will only fix problems that are github's fault (e.g. failing to download a package). It will not magically make your CI pass. In particular, the CI may fail again if your code does not pass all the test cases (repeatedly closing and opening the PR will never fix this!).

We'd need more details in order to help you! When using Git, when in doubt and confused, always look at `git status` and `git log`. `git status` tells you the current status of your source directory, which should tell you which files are having merge conflicts. `git log` helps you to see how your commit history is like, to see if you've perhaps added some commits wrongly.

My question is what if for some reason (maybe you are writing a txt tutorial on how to deal with git conflicts), that segment format is actually part of your content? Will git think it is an actual conflict? Is it thus possible to generate fake conflicts by inserting this segment intentionally to your code?

Currently, our only heuristic for picking cases within equivalence partitions is to pick boundary values and a few non-boundary values. Instead of picking an arbitrary non-boundary value, would it be a good idea to test a random value within the equivalence partition, so that every time the test suite is run, it covers a different possible value. 

The main issue I see with this is that the testing functions are non deterministic and failed test cases become hard to reproduce, but if we simply log the values used, it shouldn't be an issue.

* `File >> Settings >> Build, Execution, Deployment >> Build Tools >> Gradle >> Gradle projects >> Gradle >> Gradle JVM` set to `java version 11`

2. Not sure if this is related, but on the terminal, running `gradlew properties` reveals that:
* `sourceCompatability: 13`
* `targetCompatability: 13`
even when the actions in (1.) were taken. Currently I have no way of knowing if those properties are the cause, nor of how to change the values in those properties.

Hi everyone. I was looking into how to handle the case when a user accidentally terminates the java program without the proper exit command (e.g. via the "bye") keyword and I came across the idea of adding a [JVM Shutdown hook](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-shutdown-hook-java/). This seems to be one solution to handle this situation, and I tried implementing it like so:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38996397/91382174-aff5a200-e85b-11ea-9b9f-afb2d0e5e9b9.png)


Thought this might be useful for others. Also if anyone can explain more in-depth into what's happening under-the-hood for how the ShutdownHook works (the JVM is the one that executes the code within the hook?) ... 

Started this thread to point others to this and get pointed at similar concepts to understand this better. (Also, not sure if there's any better way than to use `System.exit()` for the `ExitCommand`)

<panel  header="**2 :fas-comment:**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/85#issuecomment-683215179" expanded>

> Is there any thing that I have to note when implementing this shutdown hook? 'cause when I try to use it, I cannot pressing ctrl + c to terminate the program any more

Hi @aidoxe-123 , did you manage to make it work?  
I didn't have to add any other code other than the screenshot on the left (with the relevant import statements magically added by IntelliJ). 




> If you implemented your main class as suggested, I don't think you'll need to use `System.exit()` since the program will automatically terminate when it reaches the end of the `main()` function.

@seowalex I'm not fully sure about this. I added in the `System.exit()` just in the meantime because prior to adding it:

1. after user is done and sends the exit command to Duke, the exit greeting is displayed by the UI and `Duke.main()` is done running
2. this shuts down the JVM since everything is done, and the hook runs, doing the necessary saving and displaying the exit greeting a second time
So I decided to just call `System.exit()` for the `execute` method for `ExitCommand`



> On a side note the hooks will not execute in the event of an unexpected termination of JVM, so its still a safer choice to save on add.

@LeeEnHao Thanks for the heads up man! yes I realise now that OS related signals (SIGKILL) and other situations can prevent the hook from running, and you're right about writing onto the hard disk upon add being a safer option.


> This is a neat trick, but ensure you are using it for the right reasons (if you are doing this because you want to save only at the shutdown, see [this comment](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/50#issuecomment-678739306)).

Thank you Prof @damithc ! This echoes @LeeEnHao 's point about writing on every add/change to the TaskList being a safer option. Now that I realise this may not be that useful a tip, should I just close this Issue?

> @ZhangWanlin98 doesn't look like this is a common problem as no one else reported it. Did you manage to solve it?

No, I have not solved it.

I think it is somehow because of the setting problem since within the tp code, I can only run new tests that are written locally with Gradle.

I have tried to add jvmArgs '--enable-preview' into test, but did not work.

In the end, I adapt to choose IntelliJ in the setting for the test and all tests works.

Hi, thank you for the prompt reply!

For solution 1, I have tried to rename the "Rui Ling" folder but I am unable to do so, since it is under Users folder. To create a new folder with no white spaces would be to create a new user account.

For solution 2, as I used these:
&gt;pre>&gt;code>dir /s /B ..\src\main\java\*.java > sources.txt
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin @sources.txt&gt;/code>&gt;/pre>
all the paths are in `sources.txt` file, and therefore I am unsure of what to do next.

Other than that, I have tried double quoting all paths in `sources.txt` but it does not work, meaning it will be as such:
`C:UsersRui LingDesktopuni y2s1cs2103tip`
when I run `runtest.bat`.

I have double quoted ..\src and ..\bin in the second line.

Hi more things that I checked are here:
The tutorial mentioned the use of a Launcher class, so the main class name has to be changed to "duke.Launcher" or  whatever other name used. 
Also, since the Launcher class has the main method, the main method in Duke needs to be removed. 

One more thing is to follow the step 3 of the tutorial for those without gradle, 

" 3. From Run > Edit Configurations, add the following line into your VM options for each of the main classes.
--module-path {JAVAFX_HOME}/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
e.g., --module-path C:/javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml "

Find the configuration with gradle task run and add the above into the VM options of that particular configuration. Not sure if this is clear, do sound out for any further clarifications.

I faced this issue myself, whereby test cases were failing due to differences in trailing white spaces between my ACTUAL.TXT and EXPECTED.TXT. The **trailing white spaces were indeed expected, but not saving properly in my EXPECTED.TXT file**. This is despite:
1. copying and pasting EXACTLY my expected output, and also 
2. manually adding trailing white spaces that were expected to the EXPECTED.TXT file. 

I noticed that whenever I added the trailing white spaces to EXPECTED.TXT, **the moment I saved the file the trailing white spaces were automatically removed by IntelliJ,** causing my test cases to fail. 

**Solution:** This can be easily solved by configuring your IntelliJ settings. Under **Preferences (or Files) > Editor > General > Save Files (or Other)**, change the setting for **"Strip trailing spaces on Save for:"** to **"None"**, as shown below.

Perhaps you can put the wait for input and receive input inside the try block as well? That way exceptions from the input process will be caught as well. 

Just a little add-on (in case the “catch Exception” was not just an example): It would also be better practice to catch more specific Exceptions as opposed to a catch-all Exception, so you can handle each type of exception appropriately, and also avoid bug masking. And you can also use a finally block to clean up after the try catch blocks! :) 

You can read up more on some exception handling best practices [here](https://dzone.com/articles/9-best-practices-to-handle-exceptions-in-java) .

Hi, I think you are confusing the keywords `final` with `static`

Final keyword:
```
// Use 'final' to make a variable immutable
private final List<Task> taskList = new ArrayList<>(100);

// Error because taskList is final
taskList = new ArrayList<>(100);
```

Static keyword:
```
// 'static' keyword ensures that there is one and only one instance at all time
class TinyCircle {
    public static int MIN_SIZE = 1; // Note: static only
    public static final int DEFAULT_SIZE = 100; // Note: static final
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {

        // Modifying static variable
        TinyCircle.MIN_SIZE = 10; // Success

        // Modifying static final variable
        TinyCircle.DEFAULT_SIZE = 50; // Error
    }
}
```

So, should we use `final` to make `List<Task> taskList` immutable? Yes, we should. It prevents accidental modifications to taskList.
But should we use `static` so that we can use `TaskList.add()` instead of `new TaskList().add()`? I would say no, to accomodate for future versions of our project in case we need to have multiple TaskLists.

Whoops! i got confused by the immutability part.

I can kind of see where you are getting from, but i will not venture there.

My short opinion is that if you make the classes immutable, you could adopt a more functional style instead of OOP. There's nothing wrong with that, it mainly depends on the style you adopt.

My code doesn't look too different from yours. Maybe someone else could give a better analysis.
```
        List<Task> taskList = new ArrayList<>(5);
        Task task1 = new ToDo("Todo 1");
        taskList.add(task1);
        Command c1 = new DoneCommand(task1);
        c1.execute();
        assertTrue(taskList.get(0).isCompleted());
```

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: Gradle hangs whenever it prints error:**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/200" expanded>

I have just started using Gradle inside my project. I tried to run the project using Gradle and everything went fine (e.g. testing whether it could print list, add a proper task) until I gave an invalid command and the project failed to give me the expected error notification output I wanted. 

For instance, when I typed in "event ". I was expecting to get the following, from printing the exception message:
```
ERROR: Please provide a summary and date of event.
Separate the dates from summary using " /at " and separate the two dates using a space.
```
However, what I got was the following screenshot. 
<img width="960" alt="error" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40953322/92722290-ea9e2500-f399-11ea-9fff-6e6ef366fed3.PNG">
I left the project loading for a few minutes but nothing came out and eventually it just remained loading there. I could not type anything. 

I tried running using Intellij instead and managed to print out the expected message as seen here.
<img width="960" alt="non error" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40953322/92722359-0e616b00-f39a-11ea-97e2-f2b2f0438959.PNG">

I fiddled a bit more and realised that as long as my error message did not contain "error:", it would work fine. So the following examples of error messages would work under Gradle. 
```
ERRORS: Please provide a summary and date of event.
Separate the dates from summary using " /at " and separate the two dates using a space.
```
```
ERROR| Please provide a summary and date of event.
Separate the dates from summary using " /at " and separate the two dates using a space.
```

However the following would not work.
```
Error: Please provide a summary and date of event.
Separate the dates from summary using " /at " and separate the two dates using a space.
```

I have already changed my error message to allow my project to run, but I'm confused about why something like this would happen. Hope somebody can clarify this for me. Thank you.

When I try to give Duke a command it does nothing and throws java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException and nullPointerException. The only thing that works is the "Bye" command and I suspect it has something to do with how the other commands attempt to manipulate elements within Duke like the TaskList. 

I tried to make the command call return just the toString of a Task but the exceptions were still thrown. Anyone encountered similar problems or know what could be causing this?
Does the run function also happen to be able to show the line number where the exception was thrown?

Some of you may have encountered the following error when attempting to create a new fat jar file using Gradle.

```
Error: LinkageError occurred while loading main class duke.Launcher
	java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: duke/Launcher has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 57.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 55.0
```
Essentially, the error occurred as we tried to run our class with an older version of Java compared to the version used to compile it. 

More specifically, in this case, we compiled our class with Java 13 and tried to run it with Java 11 as specified by versions 57 and 55 respectively.

To solve this error, navigate down to your system environment variables and set JAVA_HOME to the java 11 sdk.
Do refer to the following tutorial for a more detailed guide: https://mkyong.com/java/how-to-set-java_home-on-windows-10/

You can also print the directory of your java installation by typing `where java` in the cmd.

Hi the information on this thread solved the same issue i faced too. 

But I have a clarification that I would like to make. I am using a windows 10 OS with java version openJDK 11.0.5

1) In the JavaFX tutorial it is mentioned that there are 2 choices for setting up javaFX (no gradle vs gradle), I am not sure if following just 1 option will do? Meaning if I have an openJDK after following option 1, do i still have to follow option 2 (Copy the code to gradle)?

Thank you.

Hi! I'm not sure if I understand your question correctly. But if it is the case where your assert failing does not give an error message, it may be due to your JVM options.

I have been using the semantic commit style to do the IP. However, I just read 2103's Git Convention and realized that the style is not included in the convention. While it is mentioned that the format **scope: change** (e.g. Person class: remove static imports) is acceptable, the semantic commit style differs in capitalization and the addition of the type of change. As such, I would like to ask if it is acceptable to use the semantic commit style. 

Thank you! 

Reference: 
The format of semantic commit style is **&gt;type>(&gt;scope>): &gt;subject>** (e.g. feat: add hat wobble, feat(parser): add the ability to parse arrays).

The way I solved it was to change the `mainClassName` under `application` in `build.gradle`. 

Assuming your main entrypoint is `src/main/java/Launcher.java`, you can change the `mainClassName` from `main.java.Launcher` to just `Launcher` and re-run the shadow task

I encountered the same bug as you did and I have done the following to fix the bug.
*It seems this bug is only encountered if you use Windows because it works fine when I run from UNIX terminal using WSL2.

in the `build.gradle` file, add the following lines:
```
compileJava.options.encoding = 'UTF-8

tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
    options.encoding = 'UTF-8'
}
```
and inside `run{ ... }` and `test{ ... }` in the `build.gradle` file, add the following:
```
systemProperty "file.encoding", "utf-8"
```
Now at this point, it should not display `?` anymore when you run your chatbot using `IntelliJ`. However, since `powershell` by default does not use `UTF-8`, you will need to configure `powershell` to use `UTF-8` encoding or else you will see `?` replaced with other random characters. To configure, I simply typed the following commands inside `powershell`
```
$OutputEncoding = New-Object -typename System.Text.UTF8Encoding
[Console]::OutputEncoding = New-Object -typename System.Text.UTF8Encoding
```
Your `powershell` now should be able to display unicode characters :)
Hope this helps!

Hi all,  I am facing this problem when running the runtest.bat file on my terminal.
First I encountered this
 -> 'Javac' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

I managed to solve it by writing this in my terminal
 -> ...\text-ui-test>set path=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.5\bin;

Then I ran into this error
->'FC' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

smh my head... did anyone encounter this or is facing the same problem?

Hi I have a question regarding how the grading/progress checking is done for the individual project

For the grading script used for the individual project, is it sufficient to push all changes to the master branch of our own repository forked from `https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/ip` or do we have to submit a pull request to the master branch of `https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/ip`?

Also do we have to work purely on the master branch or can we create a new branch from the master branch and work on the branch created and then merge that branch into the master branch?

Thank you

At first, the label from Duke is displayed well, but once Duke displays a shorter label, the previous labels will become short too.
And later labels cannot be displayed well also.
Does anyone know how to fix this?

For the NoSuchElementException, it might be the case that `sc.nextLine()` is called without checking `sc.hasNext()`. Since the test input.txt file is empty, it will throw an error when the scanner cannot find the next line.

Versions:
IntelliJ : 2019.3.1
SourceTreeSetUp-3.3.9
JDK: 11

Context (What I did step by step):  
1) Did not create branch for JavaDoc, CodingStandard and Level 9. Did all on master branch. Pushed to GitHub.
2) Decided to revert master branch on local repo to the commit before all those changes. (Point A-Jar).
3) Created the 3 branches but named some branch wrongly (A-JavaDoc, A-CodingStandard)
4) Did the coding on the branches and push to GitHub. (Before merging to master branch)
5) Merged the branches to master branch, retag the commit.
6) Realised branch is name wrongly and went to rename.
7) Revert master branch to the commit before all changes again (Point A-Jar).
8) Merge branch to master again, retag.
9) Try to push but failed.
10) Went to GitHub to delete the wrongly named branch and pushed local repo again but failed.

tl;dr: My branch-A-JavaDoc and branch-A-CodingStandard is not appearing as local repo option to push. When I try to push there is some error which I do not know how to resolve.

Thank you for the assistance in advance. I can clarify again if there is anything not clear.

Hii !

When I copied the jar file to an empty folder and used the required command, it said that the file could not be accessed. Here are some things I've noted :

-> I can run Duke smoothly with no errors but when I compiled Duke.java manually, it produced errors but I suspect the root issue is because the package does not exist. However, the packages were set by Intellij automatically for me.
-> In the Manifest.MF file, the main class reference to Duke is in red
-> For some reason, I am unable to create new directories in my iP root folder (Intellij doesn't give me the option to). Im unsure if my Intellij configurations are affecting this issue

These are the main errors from compiling Duke.java :

Thanks for the recommendation prof ! It prompted me to relook at my project configurations and I realised that there was an issue with packaging because  my src>main>java folders were configured as packages by Intellij. After manually converting them to Sources Root folders, I could compile successfully and my JAR file works now :)

This is where I converted src.main.java under Project Structures :

### Context
By default, github unfolds all files in the Pull Request file diff view. 

Sometimes it may be helpful to get an overview of the directory structure before going straight into reviewing the code. You could fold each file manually, but it can take a lot of work to fold all the files that has been changed.

### Tip
In order to fold all files, hold down the `alt` key and click on the inverted caret icon in any file header.

This may be because the text content in your `label` exceeds the height of the label and hence it is being cut short.

What worked for me was adding `minHeight="-Infinity"` as an attribute to the `label` component in `DialogBox.fxml` to show the full content of the text. Maybe you could try this?

Hi prof,

May I ask whether the grading bot follows redirections? Since I have a personal domain and somehow github by default published my ip to my personal domain and https://asthenosphere.github.io/ip/ is redirected to http://asthenosphere.me/ip/. I have checked github settings and couldn't find any place to stop using my own domain (I didn't add custom domain either). Thank you!

Hi prof,

Thank you very much for the help! I think my domain server has some problem as I could access it sometimes but other times it will be a 502 bad gateway. Will investigate that more.

Remember to give sufficient details e.g.,
* Your development environment (IntelliJ version, Java version, OS, ...)
JavaFX 11.0.2, Gradle 6.6.1, IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2.1 (Ultimate Edition), Java 11.0.8, Windows 10


Hi, I'm having trouble getting the tick and cross symbols to appear in my JavaFX gui. 
I'm currently using the unicode characters in my code as seen in the first screenshot:

![invalid tick](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47620989/91931940-67d0f680-ed17-11ea-8ea2-31696aaa0ecc.png)

After some testing I realised that the only instance the symbols get output correctly is when I run the task directly from IntelliJ. 
The second screenshot shows when I run Duke as a run configuration and it outputs the tick and crosses perfectly:
![without gradle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47620989/91931962-7c14f380-ed17-11ea-880e-e28063f22698.png)

The third screenshot is when i try to run the gradle task (as you can see from the elephant symbol)  to start Duke (run task) it outputs the symbols incorrectly. 
![as a gradle task](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47620989/91932028-a4045700-ed17-11ea-95e8-e77bb407ff80.png)

I have viewed others' code who have successfully output the symbol in their sample GUI as seen here: #147, and they have used the same unicode in their code. My gut feeling tells me it could be some unicode character issues with gradle and possibly JavaFX, but I have no clue on how to remedy it, does anyone have any idea how to do so?

Hi I would like to ask how to test such a method, for example my deadline class throws a exception in the constructor
```
@Test 
    public void testDeadlineClassAutoCorrectsBlankDateField(){
        try{
            Deadline deadline = new Deadline("random_desc","");

        }catch (Exception e){
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
```
As show, i need to enclose it within a try catch method in order to even get it to function. Is there some cleaner way to do this in jUnit?
Googling this, I saw some code examples where they did: 
```
@Test(expected = Exception.class)
```
But i am unable to reproduce this on my intelij

I have 2 options to handling errors, the System.out.println way and the throw DukeException.something way.

More specifically, in the todo example in Level-5,
If I do System.out.println("todo bad"), Duke continues running, which is good*
If I throw DukeException.empty("todo bad"), Duke exits, which may not be good*
*personal preference

Since Level-5 recommends implementing Exceptions, does this mean it's ok for Duke to exit upon encountering an error?
Is there a 3rd approach I'm not seeing? Something that uses Exceptions but allows Duke to continue running?

In the [Checkstyle tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html), we are directed to the [`checkstyle.xml` found in AB3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle). However, under the header "Using Checkstyle with Gradle", a sample `build.gradle` file is given as such:

```gradle
plugins {
    id 'checkstyle'
    // other plugins
}

checkstyle {
    toolVersion = '8.23'
}
```

However, the `checkstyle.xml` file found in AB3 uses Checkstyle v8.29, which notably causes the `LineLength` rule to fail with an ambiguous error (`Unable to create Root Module`) if one follows the sample `build.gradle` as seen above. The `build.gradle` file provided in the `add-gradle-support` branch of the `ip` repo also fixes Checkstyle at v8.23. Should these references be updated?

If you implemented your main class as suggested, I don't think you'll need to use `System.exit()` since the program will automatically terminate when it reaches the end of the `main()` function.

I was looking at the new example videos for UML diagrams and was wondering if we need to include the functions from the base class in the derived class. In the videos, the classes all inherits from an abstract class so the functions should be included in the derived class. However let's say we have the following example:

class Human {
 void sleep() {...}
}

class Male extends Human {..}

Do we need to write the method sleep() in the Male class (assuming the function is not overridden) since it is already in Human class?

_In the code below, the Foo class has a variable to hold a Bar object and vice versa i.e., each object can have an association with an object of the other type._
```
class Foo {
    Bar bar;
    //...
}

class Bar {
    Foo foo;
    //...
}
```

I was just wondering since this code leads to cyclic dependency and considering how cyclic dependency makes it harder to test your code and thus should not be used from OOP perspective, when will bi-directional associations actually be useful or important?

I am having trouble with the launcher. My application seems to work fine when it is Application.launch(Duke.class, args), however when i change it to Application.launch(Main.class, args), the application echos back whatever i type to it. This means that my Duke class is handling everything. I have followed the tutorial step by step.

I am also only able to launch the GUI from the launcher class and not from gradle. Am very confused at this point.

Maybe you can try adding an empty constructor `public Duke() {}` in the Duke class. I managed to solve the problem after adding it.

Hi, perhaps you should check the console for the error messages! My jar file worked perfectly fine in the original directory within the ip folder, but it didn't work in another directory because of bugs in my Storage code. If your jar file works in your original directory, I think there might be an issue with retrieving/creating data files in your new directory. Hope it helps!

Hi @TCQian , perhaps you might want to look at the Vbar policy of the ScrollPane under"properties". By default it is vbarPolicy="AS_NEEDED"  but you can consider changing it to vbarPolicy="ALWAYS" to force the scrollbar to appear. 

If your UI is not resizable, you can try setting a fixed value to your MAX_HEIGHT as your VGrow properties might cause the ScrollPane to grow larger than your Stage and hence the excess will not be shown.

Just testing my iP for final submission and thought I should share this little edge case which others should consider handling:

If you use "|" or any other symbols for storage, consider disallowing your user from using them for task description. Otherwise, if a user does:
`event CS2103 | Lecture /at 2020-09-18`
This will cause an error when the file is saved and reloaded the next time the application is launched.

Personally, I show an error message when the user uses "|" and "\" in their description. Hope this is not too late for others to make changes! :)

Hi,

I had the hardest time fixing this error. Don't forget to check for Java version on IntelliJ terminal using `java --version`, if it still says Java 13, restart your computer. I've found that IntelliJ does not register the changes to environment variables until I restarted my computer (I've done "File -> Invalidate Caches/Restart" at least 10 times before to no avail).

Here's a few extra tips to ensure you're compiling correctly:

1) Ensure your JAVA_HOME points to the Java 11 sdk folder and not the bin folder.
2) Double check your Path variables as well. Path variable should point to your Java 11 bin folder.
3) IntelliJ, File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> Java Compiler, ensure that bytecode version is set to 11.
4) IntelliJ, File -> Project Structure -> Project Settings -> Project, ensure that project SDK is set to Java 11.
5) IntelliJ, File -> Project Structure -> Project Settings -> Modules, ensure module SDK is set to Java 11.
6) IntelliJ, File -> Project Structure -> Platform Settings -> SDKs, ensure JDK home path is pointing to correct Java 11 folder.
7) Check your build.gradle file, ensure that all dependencies are compatible with Java 11.

Cheers!

@florenciamartina Your screenshot shows that it's looking for `ACTUAL.TXT` in the `src\text-ui-test`, but that folder isn't supposed to be in `src`. I don't use Windows but I'll give this a shot.

To fix this we first need to understand what this command is doing. Those tokens starting with a `-` e.g. `-cp` and `-d` are flags you can pass to `javac` to specify certain arguments. Running `javac -help` gives a brief description of what each flag does. So `-cp` specifies a class path, and `-d` where to place the generated class files.

Now, back to the command. You modified `-cp` to `..\src\main\java`, which is probably fine for now (it'll look for your Java Files in that folder). You then modified `-d` to `..\src\bin`. This means that it'll place your generated class files in that folder. You probably don't want that, because Line 22 runs `Duke` from `..\bin`. Since your files are in different folders, it's likely the cause of your `Could Not Find` error.

How might we fix this then? You need to fix the paths. You'll probably want to change the `..\src\bin` back to `..\bin`. Btw, I also suggest removing `-source 1.8 -target 1.8`, as the website tells us to use Java 11 and those 2 will make it use Java 8.

So something like this might work:
```bat
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\*.java
```

I met the same issue and narrowed it down to the following line in `PersonBuilder`:
`public static final String DEFAULT_REMARK = "She likes aardvarks.";`

Because we set every `Person` to be built with the above default remark unless they have a remark specified, when building each `Person` in `TypicalPersons.java`, every person without a specified remark will have the default remark. However, in the equivalent json file, each person is built with their respective empty remarks.

In the original tutorial that does not ask us to modify the `equals` method, this bug is not apparent because we do not compare the `Remark` of each `Person`.

Edit: Not sure if this was the intended effect of the tutorial, or if this was a bug?

I had a lot of problems with runtest.bat, which (thankfully!) got solved eventually. My question is why are there so many different solutions, and why do they not work for some? Referring to the solutions found in #3 #4 #7 

I'm curious as to why some only need an extra path to get their .bat to run while some need complete overhauls like:

dir /s /B ..\src\main\java\*.java > sources.txt
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin @sources.txt

which replaces

javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\Duke.java

and also what does the overhaul even mean? In the original, I roughly understand what the flags mean, but I have no clue what the overhaul is talking about.

Thanks in advance! :)

Hi, I would like to suggest an alternative to the two methods above. In this case, it could be good to separate out the functionality into another class. You've accurately determined that both the deadline tasks and event tasks could be referred to as "timed tasks". So, you could try having an abstract class, TimedTask, for example, to be a child of the Tasks class. 

In this case, all timed tasks will extend this new class and have the additional functionality of a returnTime() method while still maintaining the functionality of a Task class itself. While it does not fix the typecasting issue as you would still have to typecast the tasks to TimedTask in order to access the returnTime() method, it will prevent code duplication in this case.

Hope this comment was helpful in helping you find your solution.

Personally, I don't think using exceptions as logic statements (using exceptions to determine a Todo class) is a very good practice, but it may just be me.

I'm guessing that `runtest.bat` is using an outdated version of the `Duke.class` file. This might occur after you implement packaging. 

First, try deleting all the files in `./bin/`, then running the batch file again. There should be some error about not being able to find the `Duke` class, which you can then resolve by using `java -classpath ..\bin duke.Duke &gt; input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT` instead of `java -classpath ..\bin Duke &gt; input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT`

Try replacing the cross symbol with the unicode u2718 i.e. "\u2718" and see if it works.

In SceneBuilder, click on the send button, then on the right panel, click on layout and make sure the value in this box is the same as the textfield.

Alternatively. 
If you check your javac -version it will be JDK11, but if you check your java -version it is likely not 11.
You can change your java runtime environment to the required environment it should then work.

So the scenario is that I accidentally deleted my docs folder and I already committed with new code afterwards so i asked my team member who happens to be using windows to pass me a zipped copy to replace it. Since CI kept rejecting, i decided to try cloning the docs folder from my previous git commit on the master branch and placing it inside the branch i'm working on, however the error message as shown above still keeps popping up. Is there any way to fix this issue?

Hi Prof, can I ask a question about the format of the command that the user inputs? If for a command, for example "list", there are white spaces in front of the word "list", should it be considered as the same as the command where there are no white space in front of the word or should it be considered as a different command? Thank you very much!

I have another issue when testing using the _runtest.sh_ file after including error messages thrown using custom exception classes for Level-5.

Not sure if it is caused due to using `System.err.print(ex)`; instead of `System.out.print(ex);`, causing the error messages to not be captured in the _EXPECTED-UNIX.TXT_ and _ACTUAL.TXT_ files although I included them in my _EXPECTED.TXT_ file for testing.

Hence would like to ask if it's alright to not include "expected" error messages thrown using `System.err.print(ex);` in our _EXPECTED.TXT_ file?

Hi everyone

When I was typing JavaDoc comments for Constructors, I searched up examples online and decided to go with this format:

    /** Constructor.
     *
     * @param num The index of the task to be marked as done.
     */
    public DoneCommand(int num) {
        this.num = num;
    }

I have a question though. Since the constructor is also a public method, should the Javadocs comment also start with a verb?
i.e. instead of "Constructor." its "Constructs a DoneCommand.'

I also seek for a quick clarification. Are JavaDoc comments not needed for private fields and methods? 

Thank you!
