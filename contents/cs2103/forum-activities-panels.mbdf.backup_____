<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: Keep part of code that prints output in terminal after JavaFX?**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/136" expanded>

I'm not sure whether this is a discussion worth having, but I have this small query:

I have integrated JavaFX into my project and now have a fully functional (albeit ugly-looking) GUI. I'm assuming this is the main platform users will be interacting on/with.

Does that mean the part of the code that deals with printing output onto the terminal (i.e. how we've been interacting with the user prior) is now rendered obsolete? Should I remove it to prevent unncessary bloat in my code?

The only purpose I see in keeping it right now is the fact that if I remove it, it'd be hard to do semi-automated testing using the provided `.bat`/`.sh` file, but I think unit testing using JUnit seems far more efficient as a form of automated testing.

Could anyone shed some light on this? Any comments would be appreciated!

I had a lot of trouble with getting my `.bat` file to work as well, and this is what worked for me:

If you're like me and have a very long and convoluted file path (with lots of whitespaces) to your source files, you can try using the following method:

`SET MY_PATH=<your_really_long_path_here>`

Hereafter you can refer to your path by simply calling `%MY_PATH%` wherever you need it.

Here's an example of what I'm talking about:

Regarding this line:
`SET MY_PATH="my_file_location"`

Did you encase your location path in double quotes (")? If you did, try removing the double quotes. 

i.e. Suppose my path is something like `C:\Users\blah\CS2103\ip`. Then that line would be:
`SET MY_PATH=C:\Users\blah\CS2103\ip`

The former (I just tried) gave me a similar error in your post while the latter worked just fine.

First issue regarding the cmd window closing:

Try putting a 'PAUSE' command at the end of the script, so something like:

Second issue regarding the '.bat' not working properly:

I'm not sure where your respective directories are but here's what you should be inputting for each command 'javac' and 'java':

'''
javac -cp <your_source_code_directory> Xlint:none -d <destination_directory> <file(s)_to_compile>
'''

'-cp <your_source_code_directory>': (classpath) your '.java' files should be in this specified directory.
'-d <destination_directory>': (destination directory) where your '.java' files will end up in after compilation (as '.class' files).

'''
java -classpath <your_source_code_directory> <file_to_run> < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT
'''

'classpath <your_source_code_directory>': note this should match the directory where your '.class' files ended up after compilation.

As a reference here is what my '.bat' file looks like atm:

You can try the following: 
'''
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\*.java
'''

But iirc if you compile your top-level class first (in terms of dependencies) every other relevant class should be compiled as well. Hence why calling 'javac' on just 'Duke.java' works for me

It should be in the parent directory of `src`, so in your case that would be in `ip`.

To clarify: `..` means navigate to parent directory. So if your current directory is something like `C:\Users\blah\text-ui-test`, a script inside calling for the path `..\src` implies `C:\Users\blah\src`. (`blah` is the parent directory here)

Can you elaborate (and maybe provide an example) of case 2? Not sure I fully understand it.

Nevertheless, to emphasize the notion of encapsulation, what I personally did was create a separate exception class that handles logic specific to an empty todo (or any other task for that matter) description (aptly named `DukeInvalidTaskDescriptionException`). This class extends from `DukeException`. 

By doing so I ensure that neither `Task` nor any exceptions related to the class (or its subclasses) know about each other (because imo they shouldn't). All of the logic with respect to exception handling would then be handled by the overarching driver class (`Duke` by default). This includes throwing the relevant exceptions in try-catch blocks, etc.

I faced a similar issue previously.

I solved it by placing my scanner object as a field within the 'Ui' class so that way I only have one scanner object per Ui object (as @qwoprocks has kindly suggested). Thereafter your 'readCommand' body can just look something like this:

'''
    public String readCommand() {
        return scanner.nextLine();
    }
'''

If by testing you mean continuing to use `.bat` or `.sh` files to script testing, the way I did it was pretty rudimentary:

I created a feature to support the `"delete all"` user input command. This command (as its name suggests) deletes all existing tasks (if any) in the list of tasks.

All I did afterwards was make sure this command was the first line of my `input.txt`. This allowed the task list to "reset" every time the script is run.

A cool side effect to adding this command is that users of my Duke chatbot will be able to use it in normal circumstances as well (because I think the default implementation of `delete 2`, etc. can be quite clunky especially for substantially big lists).

I'm sure there are more clever ways to go about doing this though.

Assuming your runtest.bat resides in the text-ui-test folder, it would mean that the working directory when you run it is inside the text-ui-test folder. Thus, to access the src folder you need to move one level up, which would mean just changing the filepath to "..\src\main\java\data\list.txt" (just prepend a dot)

I'm guessing that it's most likely because of the multiple creation of the Scanner object in your code, since you are creating a new Scanner every time you call the readCommand function. 

The better practice is to just create one Scanner object and use it for the entirety of the program to read inputs.

Hi if you're using the checkstyle and suppress xmls from ab3, you can change your checkstyle version (in build.gradle as well) to 8.1 and it'll get rid of the 'FileContentsHolder' error.

Maybe you can take a look at the stack trace? The java.lang.XXXException tab usually doesn't give any information, you can try clicking on the Launcher.main() lines to see if there are more details on why these exceptions were thrown. 

Usually its due to some kind of uninitialized fields or a naming issue which leads to FXML and your java code not meshing together (or maybe you forgot to set the controller, etc.)

Personally I did both!
Basically it's encased in a try catch block. 

The try block tries a static method I declared in the Duke.java file

The catch block will catch my custom exception and inside my catch block is simply a 
sys.out.println(e.getmessage())

I'm not sure if this is the right way but I fixed it by making sure that my code on github is the most updated version, then I used IntelliJ to "get from git version control" again. Then open up SouceTree and locate the new local repo I cloned. Go to remotes -> branches -> check out on all the branches and they will show up in the "branches" tab of your local repo, and I think it will show up when you click on push.

actually IMO the whole concept of immutability in java is kinda pointless because it does not have "const-correctness" like other languages. Just because your `taskList` is marked `private final`, it doesn't mean the list *itself* is immutable, only that the reference to the list is immutable.

you can't reassign the list to another new list, but you are totally free to append/delete items to/from the list. in fact, having a getter allows other people to do `list.getTasks().clear()` or something else to modify the list.
</panel>

<panel  header="**10 :fas-comment:**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/69#issuecomment-680017602" expanded>

in general you should not treat what you learn in programming modules as dogmata (eg: cs2030 said immutable classes are good, so i should always use them) (eg: cs2103 said we should program in OOP style, so i should always program in OOP), but weigh their pros and cons as you deem fit. for example, if you know that your list is gonna have hundreds or thousands of items, then it doesn't make sense to die-die make your class immutable and force a copy every time you want to modify something.

(nb: even though you're only copying pointers, a copy is still a copy)

on the other hand, if your classes are small, and (imo) generally stored in lists or something like that, you might want to make them immutable, so you can hand out references with ease-of-mind that nobodoy will change things from under your feet. good examples here might include your various `Task` classes.

anyway this problem is unique to java because of its lousy concept (or lack thereof) of "const-ness", as mentioned before. in a more sensible language you'd be able to create and pass around const references so the idea of having an "immutable class" wouldn't make sense.

@MarcusTw Hi Marcus, thanks for the answer. Unfortunately, it doesn't work in my case because the Command folder/package is gone in my local repo. However, I tried running `git rm -r Command` and it show an error message of "fatal: pathspec 'Command' did not match any files". May I know what is wrong with this?

Hi! When I was adding Increments as parallel branches: A-JavaDoc, A-CodingStandard, Level-9, I made a mistake. A-JavaDoc and A-Coding Standard branches are all created from the master branch, however, Level-9 branch was created from A-Coding standard branch instead. I only realized this after I have merged all three branches to the master branch, as shown below.  I wonder will I get penalized because of this or do I need to reset these branches and commits? Thank you very much for your help!

However, I am wondering that if after I have finished level 6, I realized that I wanted to make some small improvements on the previous levels that I have finished, can I make other commits about previous levels again after Level-6? If so, do I also need to change the tag of previous levels? And will we get penalized because of this? Thank you very much in advance!

I also encountered this problem when I ran runtest.bat on windows. As mentioned on the CS2103 website, "The likely cause that the line endings are different (not visible to the naked eye) because the two files were created in two different operating systems." Thus, I ran the runtest file using git bash again and it finally solved the problem. (in git bash, we should run runtest.sh instead, and remember to update the directory path)

Hi, I think maybe you can try delete the corrupted cache and restart Intellij again. I also met some strange issues after I imported gradle. But I solved them by first close the project, delete the .idea folder, then re-import and project and rebuild the project. Hope it helps.

> Hi, thanks for the advice. But when I delete the .idea file and restart the intellij project, it still tells me that zip END header not found. And another issue that arises by deleting .idea and restarting the project is that intellij now cannot run the java files(i.e, the java files are not recognized as runnable). so I am very confused about it..

Ohh, I think that after you re-import the project, you need to reconfigure the compiler to Java 11 again, maybe can try out the solutions mentioned [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52411697/intellij-compilation-error-zip-end-header-not-found)

The problem I think it is because of your format of setting MY_PATH, just like others said. 
Instead of setting PATH, have you tried to use the .., which means go to the parent directory? i.e. `javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\*.java`

Hi @madanalogy  Thank you for your reply! 

I found the problem and solved it. Turns out, somehow I accidentally deleted the main/java folder, so all of my codes are directly in duke folder. When I created new directory main/java, everything works fine.

Every time I run gradle build, the view directory which I placed the fxml files appears in 'build/resources/main' instead of 'build/classes/java/main' is there any way to change the gradle setting for this. It is causing the FXML.load() to load the fxml files in a directory that does not exist in 'build/classes/java/main'

Hi there, after running the shadowjar task, I attempted to runshadow, but that immediately triggered a warning:

I did a gradle clean runshadow command but it returns this error over and over again. Using the IDLE gradle runshadow task runs some form of truncated program where it opens and immediately exits by a bye command. Not sure what is happening so I came to ask for help.

There seems to be an issue with the runshadow command even though I have no problem running the normal jar file. There also seems to be a problem with installShadowDist when i tried to run it, it throws an error:

'Failure to delete directory: ip\build\install\ip-shadow'

'Failed to delete some children. This might happen because a process has files open or has its working directory set in the target directory.'

Is there something missing in my build.gradle?

Could be due to the Image(getClass.getAsResource.xxxxxx). Remove this and see if the code launches? The exception is caused by a null pointer exception. So the cause is deeper into the stack trace. This is the best I can deduce without the stack trace.

What you said is most likely the cause The invocation target exception can be solved by resolving the null pointer. So maybe somewhere in your code you are accessing an absent resource?

Hi, 

If you are trying to do level A-Gradle, I suggest reusing your code from A-JUnit to ensure everything is working correctly. I actually did gradle first instead of the JUnit level so I understand how frustrating it can be. 

If you had followed the non-gradle instructions from JUnit, then you can simply use that code to "test" that you have done A-Gradle first. Remember to create your build.gradle first (and intellij will automatically detect you are trying to install gradle). Below is a screenshot to show you how your setup should look like : 

On your left, make sure your test files are in the right directory (root>src>test>java).  Note the build.gradle file in the directory.
On the right, you can see the gradle toolbar. You can click the little elephant then type in "gradle test" and press enter
At the bottom is the gradle terminal after a successful test

I have tried several variations of line 10 and 18 of runtext.bat such as using .\src\main instead of ..\src\main and using *.java instead of Duke.java on line 10 


Now, I am stuck at this error:

The system cannot find the file specified.
FC: cannot open ACTUAL.TXT - No such file or folder

Apparently my script isnt creating an ACTUAL.TXT file. I am not sure what is the issue. If anyone could help me that would be great (: 

Alternatively, is there another way I can test my code before the dateline?

Hi Prof and Cody,

I am currently using JDK 11 and I am also using the latest version of intellij IDEA (ver 2019.3.3). I have also set the java file and as source root. 

Also, I have previously used intellij for a nodeJS project, perhaps that caused some of the issues.

Currently,  intellij is letting me know that I have no project compiler output. I am not sure how to solve this problem

The problem lies in the line ': String.format("%d.%s\n", i + 1, tasks.get(i).toString());' in your convertTaskListToString method.
Since your clearly state out that the end line is \n instead of System.lineSeparator(), the correct listMessage string should be:
'''
String listMessage = "Here are the tasks in your list:\n" +  
                "1.[T][" + CROSS_ICON + "] t1\n"  +

                "5.[E][" + CROSS_ICON + "] t5 (at: Aug 27 2020, 12:00)";
'''

Only use 'System.lineSeparator()' to represent line breaks that use 'System.out.println()' or strings that clearly refer to 'System.lineSeparator()' themselves.

This looks like a similar problem as "javac not recognized...", did you previously have this error? if not i think it has something to do with the environment path. 
You can check if you get the same error in your command prompt by typing the FC command. then you would have to edit your path system variables under environment variables.

Anyone one has faced this issue before? Or can we also move away from standard output and shift our testing to only JUnit tests for our classes. Or is the standard output still important for testing because now my Duke UI is only printing standard output for this .bat test. Appreciate any advice.

<panel  header="**3. :fas-info-circle: Question About Immutability of Class**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/69" expanded>

Regarding the convention described in the code standard, there is nothing say about immutability. 

As we know, immutability can support method chain for testing, so when is a good practice to have an immutable class?

Here is one concrete example of the testing:

- Here is my taskList class which is mutable:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54443474/91060454-8cfd9f00-e65d-11ea-96d2-45dd8b30e07c.png)

I did not make my arraylist as private final. If I want to make it private final, I need to make my method markDone(),add,delete... etc return a TaskList object. 

Now my testing is like this: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54443474/91060708-dcdc6600-e65d-11ea-8280-7d3a945d05bf.png)

If I make the TaskList and Task immutable and declare a getter function for specific index of TaskList, it is easier for testing. We can just use:

 `AssetEquals(sample.markAsDone().getStatus(), list.add(sampleInList).markDone(0).get(0).getStatus())`

after instantiating three objects to test the output.

So the main point is, when should we have an immutable class?

> actually IMO the whole concept of immutability in java is kinda pointless because it does not have "const-correctness" like other languages. Just because your `taskList` is marked `private final`, it doesn't mean the list _itself_ is immutable, only that the reference to the list is immutable.
> 
> you can't reassign the list to another new list, but you are totally free to append/delete items to/from the list. in fact, having a getter allows other people to do `list.getTasks().clear()` or something else to modify the list.

Oh yeah. If it is really immutable, I should not have the getter method, since all class are passing by reference. But there is a possibility to always use the clone() method to clone the list and pass it out. Because my usage of the getter is just to see the content, it's kind of force the use of the getter method is only to see the content because modifier on this list after cloning is kind of useless (because it will not change the object itself). But I just feel like this is not a good practice considering the efficiency.

You can significantly speed up Git on Windows by running three commands to set some config options:

git config --global core.preloadindex true
git config --global core.fscache true
git config --global gc.auto 256

The question is simple: would it be appropriate (in the context of this project) to have a "static" class?
I define a "static" class in the following manner, since top level classes can't be static by definition: 
* Only the default constructor is used, i.e. not declared
* All methods are static

Take for example the Parser class (talked in A-MoreOOP last week). I do not see a reason to make the class not "static" for the following reasons:
1. The default constructor will work fine (I do not need to pass anything, there are no instance variables)
2. For every single method, there would not be a difference in behavior if I:
a) Make the class non-"static" and instantiate it (e.g. `Parser parser = new Parser();` followed by `parser.parseCommand();`)
b) Make the class "static",  and use the class (e.g. `Parser.parseCommand();`)

And this introduces several advantages, without any apparent disadvantages that I can see directly:
1. There is no need to pass by reference if you need it - it's available for every single class to use
2. Save a little bit of space in coding since you do not need to instantiate it

Again restating the question: would it be appropriate to have a "static" class? Looking for any input. Thanks!

If I'm not mistaken, an exception would cause the program to terminate. Is there any way to throw an exception without exiting the program?

For context, I have the following pseudocode:

    receive input
    try {
        do something with input (e.g. todo, bye, etc.)

What is the inherent advantage of using inheritance instead of, let's say, enums for the type of tasks in Level 4?

Additionally, enums might have some advantages in pattern-matching (although Java being Java...)

Like the other users already mentioned, I do think throwing errors as early as possible would be better.

That said, you could look into having a private constructor and having a factory method to create instances of the class which would have checks before creating the object and thus, avoiding the problems with memory usage etc.

You could even look into other design patterns if you think this might not be proper encapsulation of Task's duties. There is a factory design pattern that seems useful and I've been reading up on.

I'm not sure if there's a proper solution to having two relative paths from different working directories point to the same one but you could create the directories to get the path you want if it isn't found.

When you normally run your program, IntelliJ runs it from the root directory and thus the `src/main/data/taskList.txt` exists.

Hi, thanks for the advice. But when I delete the .idea file and restart the intellij project, it still tells me that zip END header not found. And another issue that arises by deleting .idea and restarting the project is that intellij now cannot run the java files(i.e, the java files are not recognized as runnable). so I am very confused about it..

> @Royxuzeng You can also try using a fresh clone of the ip repo, and go through the steps carefully to step up gradle for it, just to see if the same problem occurs there as well. That will help you determine if the problem is inside your current iP project setup or more systemic to your computer/OS setup.

I tried to use a fresh clone of the ip repo but the same problem occurred so I think the ip does not have problems. When running gradlew --version in the command prompt in the project root folder, the error occurred that it cannot unzip the gradle-6.2-bin.zip so I think it might have something to do with it but I am really not sure how to fix this issue.

Do remember to install the checkstyle plugin and do the relevant configuration mentioned in "Using Checkstyle" guide.

This worked for me, let me know if it works for you as well :) Not too sure if there is another way to go about solving this issue without manually creating the directories and xml files.

I can't think of any other way except checking time string against multiple regex, and my regex is pretty bad.

For example here's one:

    Pattern p = Pattern.compile("(?<year>\\d{4})[\\s\\-.](?<month>\\d{1,2})[\\s\\-.](?<day>\\d{1,2})"
            + "[\\s\\-.T](?<hour>\\d{1,2})[\\s\\-.:]?(?<minute>\\d{2})");
    Matcher m = pattern.matcher(timeString);
    m.matches();

`Matcher.group(groupName)` can then be used to access the individual capture groups.
If the pattern cannot be matched then I just store the raw string as time.

It will be great if anyone can share a elegant approach for parsing date and time.

Thanks in advance!

In the context of this question, does "tab" mean four spaces or an unexpanded tab?

I had the same issue. Searched around and found it could be some non-printable control characters that are causing the problem.

Maybe you can try `my_string.replaceAll("\\p{Cntrl}", " ");` on both expected string and actual string to see if it helps.

I have learnt in CS2030 that classes are better if they are immutable, so I kept all my classes immutable.

For example, the list object can be immutable if we create a new list using the old list every time.

I think we can use both! 

For example, when the parent method calls the child method, pass the string to the child method as an argument. In this way, the child method can throw an exception to be caught by the parent method, which can then do the exception handling, e.g. print out the "todo bad" message. Then we don't need to terminate the programme but still manage to use exceptions.

If reviewing PR, and the code has multiples of the same mistake (eg. wrong indent for multiple files), do we flag every single mistake, or just flag one? I'm thinking that if you flag every mistake, it will just make the other member angry at why you are focusing on such minor mistakes.

To setup Gradle for my project, I created a 'build.gradle' file and added these into the file:

'''
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'application'
    id 'checkstyle'
    id 'com.github.johnrengelman.shadow' version '5.1.0'

    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.4.0'
}
'''

These were taken from the [Gradle tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html) and the [JUnit tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html). 

Afterwards, I imported the project using scenario 1 as mentioned in the Gradle tutorial and all seemed to work fine.

However, when I tried to add the annotation '@Test' and imports 'org.junit.jupiter.api.Test', 'org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals', 'org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.fail', to my test files, I encountered an error and the suggested fix was to add 'JUnit5.4' to the class path. However, nothing happened after clicking on it.

I've tried looking at my project settings and under "Libraries", it tells me that the library "Gradle: org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.4.0" "cannot resolve external dependency org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.4.0 because no repositories are defined"

I assume you are referring to level 7 and level 8. Please correct me if I'm wrong but I believe you just need to push your branches normally. So just `git checkout` the branch you want to push and then just `git push`. This will push the branches to your fork. Then go back to your `master`, and merge the level 7 and level 8 branch. then you commit the merge and tag afterwards. Once done just push your commits and tags from the master branch.

> I have learnt in CS2030 that classes are better if they are immutable, so I kept all my classes immutable.

I don't think classes are necessarily "better" if they are immutable. But it's better in the sense that they allow for more control and helps in debugging.

And so to answer the question:

> Is immutability no longer strictly desirable in higher level programming modules?

I believe it's still desirable as you want to have greater control over your program flow. So, I think a better question to ask would be "do I want my class to be immutable?" (so as to get the benefits from immutability) rather than does this programming module require/desire immutability for my classes.

Someone do correct me if my understanding is wrong.

I tried adding a conflict marker in a text file ( with an existing commit id) and it seems like git won't generate such conflicts and manually entering conflict markers will not work.

To delete a tag, I use `git tag --delete origin tagname`. Just make sure that the tagname does not clash with any branch's name or it will delete the branch as you said. The former method you used is indeed safer and it works for me, but remember to delete to local tag also.

I suppose the runtest script is not linking javafx (3rd party library), thats why it says those classes do not exist.
On a side note, the runtest is to test the text UI, but since you have added GUI, the text is not in standard output anymore which could not be tested by the script. You can use Junit to test methods output though. 
For actuall GUI testing, we need another 3rd party library, maybe Espresso?

I have this error when running from the Main class. The thing is everything runs fine if its initiated from Launcher class. 
Does anyone have the same issue?

My current implementation in Launcher class is this:
'
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Application.launch(Main.class, args);
    }
'

That is because your path will read from where you run the command, meaning running from runtest.bat vs Duke class would have different starting file location. One way to solve this is by doing this:

'''
public final static String FILEPATH = System.getProperty("user.dir") + (System.getProperty("user.dir").endsWith("text-ui-test")
        ? "/saved-tasks.txt"
        : "/text-ui-test/saved-tasks.txt");
''' 
This assumes that you put your storage inside text-ui-test, you have to adjust the accordingly depending on where you put your storage file.

Use this FILEPATH as an argument in your FileReader/Writer. Hope this helps!

Are you trying to merge the level branches with master branch? If so, you have to ensure that you are at master branch before pulling other branches. 
Use `git branch` to check the branches available in your code, and use  `git checkout <branch_name>`
to enter the branch.
Once you're at master branch, enter `git merge --no-ff <branch_name>`

Not really sure whats the best way to move forward as I do not know your current github status (since udk too..) but the best bet would be forcing yourself to move to a particular commit. You can check on github with commit code you want to revert your work to, and enter `git reset --hard <commit_id>` or `git reset --hard HEAD`
I think from here onwards, you should be able to push and pull, just take note of the changes you have done before the issue came about.

You can also check https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/77 to see if you have the same issue

In your build.gradle, you have to change the versioning to '8.29'
'checkstyle {
    toolVersion = '8.29'
}'
The bug was just found recently and prof just made the changes to the branch. Hope this helps!

IntelliJ will direct you to the exact location when you click on the link. Sadly checkstyle can't be used to automate correction so you have to do it manually.

Hi prof just a question on the preferred tagging habit, if I have changed two tags simultaneously eg. A-OOP and A-Packaging, should we delete the old tags and retag them at the one updated commit or do we just leave the old tags where they are and write out the corresponding updates in the updated commit message?

You can also go to where your main iP folder is and create a new folder inside called data. It will appear in intellij, then right click on the new folder in intellij and create a new file (Duke.txt) from there. Hope this helps!

Greetings!

JDK 11; IntelliJ 2020.2

After I improved the packaging of my classes and added J-Unit tests, the runtest.sh file is unable to give a successful result. I tried to fix it with extensive searching and help from peers but I am unable to solve still.

Following is the error I get when I run runtest.sh (My bot name is Dobby):
Error: Could not find or load main class Dobby

dos2unix: converting file ACTUAL.TXT to Unix format...
dos2unix: converting file EXPECTED-UNIX.TXT to Unix format...

I also made a shell-script configuration (script path is of runtest.sh) for runtest.sh which gives a build failure:
no matches found: ../src/main/java/dobby/*.java
********** BUILD FAILURE **********

Compiling code in runtest.sh:
javac -cp ../src/main/java/dobby -Xlint:none -d ../bin ../src/main/java/dobby/*.java ../src/main/java/dobby/task/*.java

Code to run the program in runtest.sh:
java -classpath ../bin Dobby < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT

My code structure is as follows:
ip/src/main/java/dobby/Dobby.java (and other java files- package dobby)
ip/src/main/java/dobby/task/Task.java (and other task related java files - package dobby.task)

The java folder inside main is the sources root.

Thank you in advance! I can clarify anything if required!

Hello, I think I found the problem! All this while, the wrong directory was marked as the module in my project structure (it was `[project root]` but it should be `[project root]/src/main`). I followed these steps to solve the issue:
1. Remove old `[project root]/src/test` directory as module and delete it
2. Remove `[project root]` directory as module
3. Go to File > New > Module from Existing Sources and choose `[project root]/src/main`, then selecting `Create module from existing sources` followed by all the default settings.
4. Mark `[project root]/src/main/java` as source root if you havent done so
5. Now follow the instructions [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html) again and it should work!

Hi, for the Automated Text UI Testing for IP week 2, we are required to replace the classpath for the .bat file(on Windows)

From the [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/textUiTesting.html), it mentioned: 

Update the javac and java commands in the script to match the name/location of your main class.
If you are using packages, the two commands need to take the packages into account too.

However, im not sure what javac and java commands that we would have to change. What I did was to change the locations after the ..\bin command to the directory of my java files. But everytime I ran the .bat file, a command prompt window opens and quickly closes. There is no ACTUAL.txt in the same directory as well. 

Thanks for helping :D

Thanks so much, but right now I realised that I have multiple java files since I have more than 1 class,

So what I did was to just to repeat the javac statement multiple times.
I.e
'''
REM compile the code into the bin folder
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\Task.java
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\ToDo.java
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\Deadline.java
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\EventTask.java
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\Duke.java
'''
But it is still treated as if Task.java is not compiled, resulting in an error when ToDo tries to extend from Task.java but is unable to find Task.java

May I ask please ask how to then compile multiple java files?

Thanks!

Hi, if you packaged your duke class, perhaps you want to try going to your `fx:controller="MainWindow"` in the fxml file and changing it to duke.MainWindow?

Hi all, does anyone know how to set up checkstyle properly?
I'm using the default version for checkstyle defined in build.Gradle (v8.23). I downloaded the config/checkstyle folder from the addressbook repo and when I tried to configure checkstyle, I'm have to initialise config_loc and have the following error. Wasn't really shown in the tutorial so I'm not sure how to go around this.

Git uses this format

to indicate that there is a conflict. (I had to add // to prevent weird formatting)
My question is what if for some reason (maybe you are writing a txt tutorial on how to deal with git conflicts), that segment format is actually part of your content? Will git think it is an actual conflict? Is it thus possible to generate fake conflicts by inserting this segment intentionally to your code?

Hi, I noticed that the [CS2103T website](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/website/schedule/week4/project.html) mentions a "Gradle tutorial at the Duke repo" for implementing Gradle into our project.

Have you tried changing the version of javafx to 11.0.2 in the build.gradle file? According to the [bug tracker for javafx](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8211304) the fix has been backported to version 11.0.2, but I am not able to test since I'm on Windows.
This version upgrade doesn't require a newer version of JDK.

I think I ran into a similar problem when copy pasting the code for the 4th tutorial. Have you placed the copy pasted code into a package? If so, go through the fxml files and make sure that all class names mentioned in those files have the proper naming for them, with the package name included. (For example, in `MainWindow.fxml` check that `fx:controller="MainWindow"` is changed to `fx:controller="duke.MainWindow"` or whatever your package naming is.)

Within a constructor, you can call other constructors of the class directly by using their corresponding signature. 

So in your case, you can just use this in your no-argument constructor: `this("./data", "./data/tasks.txt");`

For your current solution, I believe you will be creating 2 Duke objects when u call your no-argument constructor

Try running the clean build on Gradle and then run your whole project again. It could be that the class files are not updated and hence the program does not reflect your changes to Main or Duke.

Hi, thank you for the prompt reply!

For solution 1, I have tried to rename the "Rui Ling" folder but I am unable to do so, since it is under Users folder. To create a new folder with no white spaces would be to create a new user account.

For solution 2, as I used these:
<pre><code>dir /s /B ..\src\main\java\*.java > sources.txt
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin @sources.txt</code></pre>
all the paths are in `sources.txt` file, and therefore I am unsure of what to do next.

Other than that, I have tried double quoting all paths in `sources.txt` but it does not work, meaning it will be as such:
`C:UsersRui LingDesktopuni y2s1cs2103tip`
when I run `runtest.bat`.

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: Dynamic Subclass Instance returned in Factory Method**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/35" expanded>

Suppose there is a Class 'Toy' and there subclasses 'BigToy', 'MediumToy' and 'SmallToy'. All toys have to be either Big, Medium, or Small. There is a static Factory method 'createToy' in Toy that returns an object of the respective subclass depending on the arguments passed to it. Pseudocode: 

'''
class Toy {
    Toy createToy(identifier) {
        switch (identifier) {
           case BIG: return new BigToy();
           case MEDIUM: return new MediumToy();
           case SMALL: return new SmallToy();
           default: throw exception;
        }
    }
}
'''

This solution to dynamically return a subclass in a factory method, albeit working, is in clear violation of the _Open-Closed Principle_ as there is need to modify/change the factory every time a new Sub-Class is created. Is there a better, more-dynamic solution to the problem of returning the appropriate sub-class object in the super-class factory method?

One solution I can think of is to have a "map" of the identifier to the subclasses and modify that. However, I am unsure as to how the value of this "map" can be made to create an object. Something like: 'return new map[identifier];'. Is this solution a valid approach or does it fall prey to the Open-Closed Principle also?

I would like to ask exactly how much freedom do we have with respect to the Individual Project. Is it only limited to the appearance level? Or do we have some freedoms with respect to the actual functionality of the chatbot? For example, let's say that the user enters the command: `todo finish ip /by Thursday 2359`.  Should we interpret it as the description is `"finish ip /by Thursday 2359"` (which is what the current documentation on the website implies)? Or are we allowed to customize it in such a way that it throws an exception as there is an additional parameter?

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: Throwing checked exceptions in constructors**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/24" expanded>

Is the throwing of checked exceptions in constructors considered poor practice in software design?

For illustration, consider a checked exception called `DukeException`, a class called `Task` and the scenario of say, writing a command "todo" without any description.  

**Case 1:** The `Task` constructor throws a `DukeException` on being passed a `null` string as description. 
The benefit (per my understanding) is that it localizes exception logic to the `Task` class. However, this would imply that any user of the `Task` class must always wrap object creation in a `try-catch` block (not sure if this is problematic).

**Case 2:**  The user creating `Task` objects raises a `DukeException` for a null string before calling the `Task` constructor. A benefit is that it avoids problems with object initialization, creation or memory usage. However, this might lead to duplication of code (for example, if neither `Todos`, `Events` or `Deadlines` (which are all `Tasks`) are permitted to have empty descriptions). 

Could someone throw some light on my dilemma (or possible point out flaws in my reasoning?). Thanks in advance!

Hi, I think you are confusing the keywords 'final' with 'static'

Final keyword:
'''
// Use 'final' to make a variable immutable
private final List<Task> taskList = new ArrayList<>(100);

// Error because taskList is final
taskList = new ArrayList<>(100);
'''

Static keyword:
'''
// 'static' keyword ensures that there is one and only one instance at all time
class TinyCircle {
    public static int MIN_SIZE = 1; // Note: static only
    public static final int DEFAULT_SIZE = 100; // Note: static final
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {

        // Modifying static variable
        TinyCircle.MIN_SIZE = 10; // Success

        // Modifying static final variable
        TinyCircle.DEFAULT_SIZE = 50; // Error
    }
}
'''

So, should we use 'final' to make 'List<Task> taskList' immutable? Yes, we should. It prevents accidental modifications to taskList.
But should we use 'static' so that we can use 'TaskList.add()' instead of 'new TaskList().add()'? I would say no, to accomodate for future versions of our project in case we need to have multiple TaskLists.

Whoops! i got confused by the immutability part.

I can kind of see where you are getting from, but i will not venture there.

My short opinion is that if you make the classes immutable, you could adopt a more functional style instead of OOP. There's nothing wrong with that, it mainly depends on the style you adopt.

My code doesn't look too different from yours. Maybe someone else could give a better analysis.

I think `reading each others' data` refers to (directly) accessing other objects' instance variables, which is widely known as bad practice.

However, for `sending each other messages`, it could refer to method invocation in the case of `Java/C#/C++` (see [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2348069)) which is a more "desirable" method (no pun intended) for objects to interact with other objects (as methods serve as encapsulation of the object's variables).

From 'error: invalid flag: C:\Users\Rui' and the line after, it seems as if 'javac' in 'javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\Duke.java
' in 'runtest.bat' is attempting to use 'C:\Users\Rui' as a flag. And as you correctly pointed out, this is caused by having whitespaces in folder or file names.

I can think of two possible solutions:
1. remove the whitespaces in your file and folder names, or
2. replace 'javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\Duke.java' with 'javac  -cp "..\src" -Xlint:none -d "..\bin ..\src\main\java\Duke.java"' in 'runtest.bat' (line 10). Basically surround all paths with " ". 

Hope this helps! Do let me know if 2 works so I can submit a PR to [the repo](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/ip/blob/master/text-ui-test/runtest.bat) to prevent future occurrences of this issue for anyone else.

Ah I see.

What I meant was double quoting "..\src" and "..\bin" in runtest.bat so that javac can recognize them as file paths rather than options.

As for the disappearing \\, trying double backslash \\\\ rather than single \ backslash for each path in sources.txt might work... if my memory of hosting minecraft servers serves me right 😂 (as each backslash character needs to be escaped within " ") .

eg "C:\foo\bar" -> "C:\\\\foo\\\\bar"

When I try to give Duke a command it does nothing and throws java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException and nullPointerException.

Hi the information on this thread solved the same issue i faced too. 

But I have a clarification that I would like to make. I am using a windows 10 OS with java version openJDK 11.0.5

1) In the JavaFX tutorial it is mentioned that there are 2 choices for setting up javaFX (no gradle vs gradle), I am not sure if following just 1 option will do? Meaning if I have an openJDK after following option 1, do i still have to follow option 2 (Copy the code to gradle)?

I have been using the semantic commit style to do the IP. However, I just read 2103's Git Convention and realized that the style is not included in the convention. While it is mentioned that the format **scope: change** (e.g. Person class: remove static imports) is acceptable, the semantic commit style differs in capitalization and the addition of the type of change. As such, I would like to ask if it is acceptable to use the semantic commit style. 

Thank you! 

Reference: 
The format of semantic commit style is **<type>(<scope>): <subject>** (e.g. feat: add hat wobble, feat(parser): add the ability to parse arrays).

The tutorial mentioned the use of a Launcher class, so the main class name has to be changed to "duke.Launcher" or  whatever other name used. 
Also, since the Launcher class has the main method, the main method in Duke needs to be removed. 

One more thing is to follow the step 3 of the tutorial for those without gradle, 

" 3. From Run > Edit Configurations, add the following line into your VM options for each of the main classes.
--module-path {JAVAFX_HOME}/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
e.g., --module-path C:/javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml "

Find the configuration with gradle task run and add the above into the VM options of that particular configuration. Not sure if this is clear, do sound out for any further clarifications. 

Hope this helps!

Hi everyone 

I discovered today that my tags' naming was not right and thus the issue tracker didnot catch my commits for all levels. Therefore I edited my tags today, may I know if this change can be captured in time ? Also, may I ask if the catching of the tag names is case-sensitive ? As I have name some level using small letters and for git, it is the same (NOT case sensitive). 

Thank you for your help !

@Raymond0212 Hi friend, I found out to update the tag letter cases, we need to $ git push origin :refs/tags/level-1     to delete the original lower case tag and then $git push --tags   to push our new local tags (Suppose you alr have Level-1 tag locally).

Hi I have a question regarding how the grading/progress checking is done for the individual project

For the grading script used for the individual project, is it sufficient to push all changes to the master branch of our own repository forked from `https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/ip` or do we have to submit a pull request to the master branch of `https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/ip`?

Also do we have to work purely on the master branch or can we create a new branch from the master branch and work on the branch created and then merge that branch into the master branch?

Thank you

I faced this issue myself, whereby test cases were failing due to differences in trailing white spaces between my ACTUAL.TXT and EXPECTED.TXT. The **trailing white spaces were indeed expected, but not saving properly in my EXPECTED.TXT file**. This is despite:
1. copying and pasting EXACTLY my expected output, and also 
2. manually adding trailing white spaces that were expected to the EXPECTED.TXT file. 

I noticed that whenever I added the trailing white spaces to EXPECTED.TXT, **the moment I saved the file the trailing white spaces were automatically removed by IntelliJ,** causing my test cases to fail. 

**Solution:** This can be easily solved by configuring your IntelliJ settings. Under **Preferences (or Files) > Editor > General > Save Files (or Other)**, change the setting for **"Strip trailing spaces on Save for:"** to **"None"**, as shown below.

Perhaps you can put the wait for input and receive input inside the try block as well? That way exceptions from the input process will be caught as well. 

Just a little add-on (in case the “catch Exception” was not just an example): It would also be better practice to catch more specific Exceptions as opposed to a catch-all Exception, so you can handle each type of exception appropriately, and also avoid bug masking. And you can also use a finally block to clean up after the try catch blocks! :) 

You can read up more on some exception handling best practices [here](https://dzone.com/articles/9-best-practices-to-handle-exceptions-in-java) .

At first, the label from Duke is displayed well, but once Duke displays a shorter label, the previous labels will become short too.
And later labels cannot be displayed well also.
Does anyone know how to fix this?

@EugeneTeu Yep, I decided to use Gradle instead, and the problem is resolved. What I did was as follows:

1. Add the following code to 'build.gradle':

'''
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    String javaFxVersion = '11'

    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'

2. In the Terminal, I ran './gradlew build'.

After that, I was able to follow the rest of the instructions for JavaFX tutorial part 1 with no problem. I shall close this issue.

I got carried away and did the levels of A-JavaDoc, A-CodingStandard, and Level-9 on the Master branch by accident. I committed the changes and push all 3 levels on the master branch before realizing my mistake. 

I have then created the branches separately and checked out the branch.

Versions:
IntelliJ : 2019.3.1
SourceTreeSetUp-3.3.9
JDK: 11

Context (What I did step by step):  
1) Did not create branch for JavaDoc, CodingStandard and Level 9. Did all on master branch. Pushed to GitHub.
2) Decided to revert master branch on local repo to the commit before all those changes. (Point A-Jar).
3) Created the 3 branches but named some branch wrongly (A-JavaDoc, A-CodingStandard)
4) Did the coding on the branches and push to GitHub. (Before merging to master branch)
5) Merged the branches to master branch, retag the commit.
6) Realised branch is name wrongly and went to rename.
7) Revert master branch to the commit before all changes again (Point A-Jar).
8) Merge branch to master again, retag.
9) Try to push but failed.
10) Went to GitHub to delete the wrongly named branch and pushed local repo again but failed.

tl;dr: My branch-A-JavaDoc and branch-A-CodingStandard is not appearing as local repo option to push. When I try to push there is some error which I do not know how to resolve.

Thank you for the assistance in advance. I can clarify again if there is anything not clear.

Hii !

When I copied the jar file to an empty folder and used the required command, it said that the file could not be accessed. Here are some things I've noted :

-> I can run Duke smoothly with no errors but when I compiled Duke.java manually, it produced errors but I suspect the root issue is because the package does not exist. However, the packages were set by Intellij automatically for me.
-> In the Manifest.MF file, the main class reference to Duke is in red
-> For some reason, I am unable to create new directories in my iP root folder (Intellij doesn't give me the option to). Im unsure if my Intellij configurations are affecting this issue

These are the main errors from compiling Duke.java :

Thanks for the recommendation prof !

This is where I converted src.main.java under Project Structures :

### Context
By default, github unfolds all files in the Pull Request file diff view. 

Sometimes it may be helpful to get an overview of the directory structure before going straight into reviewing the code. You could fold each file manually, but it can take a lot of work to fold all the files that has been changed.

### Tip
In order to fold all files, hold down the `alt` key and click on the inverted caret icon in any file header.

This may be because the text content in your `label` exceeds the height of the label and hence it is being cut short.

What worked for me was adding `minHeight="-Infinity"` as an attribute to the `label` component in `DialogBox.fxml` to show the full content of the text. Maybe you could try this?

I have 2 options to handling errors, the System.out.println way and the throw DukeException.something way.

More specifically, in the todo example in Level-5,
If I do System.out.println("todo bad"), Duke continues running, which is good*
If I throw DukeException.empty("todo bad"), Duke exits, which may not be good*
*personal preference

Since Level-5 recommends implementing Exceptions, does this mean it's ok for Duke to exit upon encountering an error?
Is there a 3rd approach I'm not seeing? Something that uses Exceptions but allows Duke to continue running?

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: Checkstyle tutorial out-of-date**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/88" expanded>

In the [Checkstyle tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html), we are directed to the ['checkstyle.xml' found in AB3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle). However, under the header "Using Checkstyle with Gradle", a sample 'build.gradle' file is given as such:

'''gradle
plugins {
    id 'checkstyle'
    // other plugins
}

checkstyle {
    toolVersion = '8.23'
}
'''

However, the 'checkstyle.xml' file found in AB3 uses Checkstyle v8.29, which notably causes the 'LineLength' rule to fail with an ambiguous error ('Unable to create Root Module') if one follows the sample 'build.gradle' as seen above. The 'build.gradle' file provided in the 'add-gradle-support' branch of the 'ip' repo also fixes Checkstyle at v8.23. Should these references be updated?

If you implemented your main class as suggested, I don't think you'll need to use `System.exit()` since the program will automatically terminate when it reaches the end of the `main()` function.

This means that we should configure our IDE to not use wildcard imports.

To do so in IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Open Preferences > Editor > Code Style > Java > Imports
2. Set both `Class count to use import with '*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'` to an unreachably high number.

We'd need more details in order to help you! When using Git, when in doubt and confused, always look at `git status` and `git log`. `git status` tells you the current status of your source directory, which should tell you which files are having merge conflicts. `git log` helps you to see how your commit history is like, to see if you've perhaps added some commits wrongly.

So based on what I know, generally it is safer to us immutability. I understand that using mutable objects are easy to work with and use, the benefit of using immutable objects is the reduction of side effects. I'm sure you have seen first hand the possible side effects of using mutable objects. Immutable objects are more troublesome to use, but it allows you to add-on future areas without having to worry about the side effects it may cause your existing functions. But having said that, I'm currently not using immutable objects as well purely due to it being more troublesome to work with and due to time constraints hahah.

I encountered the same bug as you did and I have done the following to fix the bug.
*It seems this bug is only encountered if you use Windows because it works fine when I run from UNIX terminal using WSL2.

in the 'build.gradle' file, add the following lines:
'''
compileJava.options.encoding = 'UTF-8

tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
    options.encoding = 'UTF-8'
}
'''
and inside 'run{ ... }' and 'test{ ... }' in the 'build.gradle' file, add the following:
'''
systemProperty "file.encoding", "utf-8"
'''
Now at this point, it should not display '?' anymore when you run your chatbot using 'IntelliJ'. However, since 'powershell' by default does not use 'UTF-8', you will need to configure 'powershell' to use 'UTF-8' encoding or else you will see '?' replaced with other random characters. To configure, I simply typed the following commands inside 'powershell'
'''
$OutputEncoding = New-Object -typename System.Text.UTF8Encoding
[Console]::OutputEncoding = New-Object -typename System.Text.UTF8Encoding
'''
Your 'powershell' now should be able to display unicode characters :)
Hope this helps!

after importing my project with Gradle, I found that my project structure had changed.

When you deleted the Level-5 tag, I think you did not delete it from the remote. Went to take a look at your repo and your Level-5 tag commit hash does not match the one that is shown when you did `git log`  Maybe you can try the following: 

1.  `git tag -d Level-5` -  This will delete the Level-5 tag locally
2.  `git push origin :refs/tags/Level-5` - This will delete the Level-5 tag on the remote. If that doesn't work, try:
`git push --delete origin Level-5`
3.  Create the Level-5 tag at the commit you want again
4. `git push origin refs/tags/Level-5` or `git push origin Level-5` - This will push your local Level-5 tag onto the remote

You can skip 1 and 3 if you are sure there's nothing wrong with your Level-5 tag locally.

Hi everyone. I was looking into how to handle the case when a user accidentally terminates the java program without the proper exit command (e.g. via the "bye") keyword and I came across the idea of adding a [JVM Shutdown hook](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-shutdown-hook-java/). This seems to be one solution to handle this situation, and I tried implementing it like so:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38996397/91382174-aff5a200-e85b-11ea-9b9f-afb2d0e5e9b9.png)


Thought this might be useful for others. Also if anyone can explain more in-depth into what's happening under-the-hood for how the ShutdownHook works (the JVM is the one that executes the code within the hook?) ... 

Started this thread to point others to this and get pointed at similar concepts to understand this better. (Also, not sure if there's any better way than to use `System.exit()` for the `ExitCommand`)

> Is there any thing that I have to note when implementing this shutdown hook? 'cause when I try to use it, I cannot pressing ctrl + c to terminate the program any more

Hi @aidoxe-123 , did you manage to make it work?  
I didn't have to add any other code other than the screenshot on the left (with the relevant import statements magically added by IntelliJ). 




> If you implemented your main class as suggested, I don't think you'll need to use `System.exit()` since the program will automatically terminate when it reaches the end of the `main()` function.

@seowalex I'm not fully sure about this. I added in the `System.exit()` just in the meantime because prior to adding it:

1. after user is done and sends the exit command to Duke, the exit greeting is displayed by the UI and `Duke.main()` is done running
2. this shuts down the JVM since everything is done, and the hook runs, doing the necessary saving and displaying the exit greeting a second time
So I decided to just call `System.exit()` for the `execute` method for `ExitCommand`



> On a side note the hooks will not execute in the event of an unexpected termination of JVM, so its still a safer choice to save on add.

@LeeEnHao Thanks for the heads up man! yes I realise now that OS related signals (SIGKILL) and other situations can prevent the hook from running, and you're right about writing onto the hard disk upon add being a safer option.


> This is a neat trick, but ensure you are using it for the right reasons (if you are doing this because you want to save only at the shutdown, see [this comment](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/50#issuecomment-678739306)).

Thank you Prof @damithc ! This echoes @LeeEnHao 's point about writing on every add/change to the TaskList being a safer option. Now that I realise this may not be that useful a tip, should I just close this Issue?

Hi Prof, just to clarify further. This means both children and fiction are in the same arraylist of the same class, and hence they "know about each other"? (Ie Bidirectional navigability)

I am having trouble with the launcher. My application seems to work fine when it is Application.launch(Duke.class, args), however when i change it to Application.launch(Main.class, args), the application echos back whatever i type to it. This means that my Duke class is handling everything. I have followed the tutorial step by step.

I am also only able to launch the GUI from the launcher class and not from gradle. Am very confused at this point.

Thank you @AlexCQY, I had the same issue and the suggested program by prof helped to identify the differences (mine were due to white spaces) that were indeed missed by sight.

In case 2, duplication of code can be mitigated if you have a single method for creating the subclasses of Task.

`public Task createTask(String type, String description) throws DukeException`

Then there will only be a single check for whether description is empty or poorly formatted, which throws exception.
This was how I attempted this issue, hope it provides some clarity.

@florenciamartina Your screenshot shows that it's looking for 'ACTUAL.TXT' in the 'src\text-ui-test', but that folder isn't supposed to be in 'src'. I don't use Windows but I'll give this a shot.

To fix this we first need to understand what this command is doing. Those tokens starting with a '-' e.g. '-cp' and '-d' are flags you can pass to 'javac' to specify certain arguments. Running 'javac -help' gives a brief description of what each flag does. So '-cp' specifies a class path, and '-d' where to place the generated class files.

Now, back to the command. You modified '-cp' to '..\src\main\java', which is probably fine for now (it'll look for your Java Files in that folder). You then modified '-d' to '..\src\bin'. This means that it'll place your generated class files in that folder. You probably don't want that, because Line 22 runs 'Duke' from '..\bin'. Since your files are in different folders, it's likely the cause of your 'Could Not Find' error.

How might we fix this then? You need to fix the paths. You'll probably want to change the '..\src\bin' back to '..\bin'. Btw, I also suggest removing '-source 1.8 -target 1.8', as the website tells us to use Java 11 and those 2 will make it use Java 8.

So something like this might work:
'''bat
javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\*.java
'''

I'm guessing that `runtest.bat` is using an outdated version of the `Duke.class` file. This might occur after you implement packaging. 

First, try deleting all the files in `./bin/`, then running the batch file again. There should be some error about not being able to find the `Duke` class, which you can then resolve by using `java -classpath ..\bin duke.Duke < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT` instead of `java -classpath ..\bin Duke < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT`

Alternatively. 
If you check your javac -version it will be JDK11, but if you check your java -version it is likely not 11.
You can change your java runtime environment to the required environment it should then work.
