In one of my exception handlers, I print some helpful, user-readable error messages, followed by a call to `e.printStackTrace();` which prints the exception stack trace to `System.err`. The application then continues as normal, printing normal operation messages. 

The expected output is:
```
Sorry there was an error, here's the stack trace:
*stack trace*
*normal operation message*
```

But the actual output is:
```
Sorry there was an error, here's the stack trace:
*normal operation message*
*stack trace*
```

I've experienced in the past that `System.err` is much slower to print to than `System.out`, and I suspect that's why this is happening. Is there any recommended workaround for this problem then? I could use `Thread.sleep()` but that doesn't sound like good code...

Hi again everyone, it's me back again with yet another thing I broke...

So for my Junit test, I wanted to test the (printed) output of a piece of code, which in itself required some wonky workarounds (setting `System.out` to a different outputstream and comparing...) However, the same issue with CRLF vs LF reared its ugly head... again.

As we know, running the program in Windows will result in using CRLF for the output. However, when I use assertEquals, my String uses LF so it doesn't pass the test. I changed the string to use `\r\n` instead of `\n` and it passed the test; however, now it fails on Ubuntu (and I suspect it will also do so on macOS)

Is there any way to modify the test for different platforms so it, for example, matches to a different String depending on the platform?

<panel  header="**3. :fas-info-circle: Method parameters and testability**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2021S1/forum/issues/97" expanded>

Suppose I have a class defined as follows:

```java
public class Notebook() {
    private String title;
    private String content;

    // method 1: using parameters
    private void printNotebookWithTitleParameters(String notebookTitle, String notebookContent) {
        // print it with both notebookTitle and notebookContent
    }
    
    private void printNotebookParameters(String notebookContent) { 
        // print the notebookContent
    }

    // method 2: using the instance members defined
    private void printNotebookWithTitleNoParameters() {
        // print this.title, this.content
    }
   
    private void printNotebookNoParameters() {
        // print this.content
    }
    ...
    public void print(boolean withTitle) {
        if (withTitle) {
            // method 1:
            printNotebookWithTitleParameters(title, content);
            // method 2:
            printNotebookWithTitleNoParameters();
        } else { 
            // method 1: 
            printNotebookParameters(content);
            // method 2:
            printNotebookNoParameters();
        }
     }
}
```

Which of the two methods (1 or 2) is preferred for elegance and testability? @longngng argues that method 1 is better, because it makes the methods more general, and easier to test because they do not depend on the instance variables. I argue that method 2 is better, because in unit testing, we would have to instantiate the class anyway to test the methods, and using the parameters causes unnecessary redundancy and increased coupling. 

Great day, everyone :D

<panel  header="**4. :fas-info-circle: Static classes vs instances**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2021S1/forum/issues/88" expanded>

According to the lectures, and the notes on the website/textbook, something like 

```java
InputParser ip = new InputParser ();
arguments = ip.getArguments(input);
```

Is preferred over 
```java
arguments = InputParser.getArguments(input);
```

However, if we have a class for printing the messages in the UI, must that also be instantiated every time? It would have to be instantiated in almost every single class in our program which I feel would bloat it somewhat. On the other hand it would make it less easily testable.

In my iP, I wanted to use some text files as resources, containing some (not user-generated) data for my program. In the IDE, I was able to do so using the normal Files method, but this doesn't work with accessing files within a jar, as seen in #51 . 

I followed the tutorials online, but I couldn't seem to get the IDE to package the resources folder inside my jar, no matter what I tried. Finally, after poking around in the project settings, here's what I found out you have to do:

0. Create a resources folder under `src/main`, and put the resources you will need in that directory. 

1. Go to File -> Project Structure

2. Go to Modules on the left

3. Go to the Sources tab on the right

4. Find your resources folder

5. Select the resources folder, and then click on "Mark as: Resources"

6. Click OK

Now whenever you build the project, or build a JAR, it will also include the resources folder and you can use it correctly. 

(NB. This might be super obvious but it sure wasn't to me yesterday when I spent four hours trying to figure it out)

<panel  header="**6. :fas-info-circle: [General] Forking vs Branching for group projects**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2021S1/forum/issues/44" expanded>

As NUS SoC students, we all have to do many group projects, most of which involve collaborating on code. I've used GitHub in the past for this, but mostly in the very simple "everyone just commits to master" style. Of course, with CS2113T, we're all now more familiar with advanced git and revision control strategies. 

Prof, can I ask, in your opinion, for the type of small group project that we often undertake, what's the best approach of these:

- Creating a GitHub Organisation for the project and creating a repository under the organisation that everyone contributes to via forks and PRs. 
- One member making a repository on their account and everyone making a fork and submitting PRs. 
- One member making a repository on their account and everyone making a separate branch and submitting PRs. 
- One member making a repository on their account and everyone committing to a separate "development" branch, and then submitting PRs to master.
- Committing directly to master. 

While PRs are very good for organising code, I think they can be a bit of a hassle for smaller projects where speed is more important than code quality (as long as there are no bugs, which should be tested before committing). I wonder if Prof has any advice on choosing an approach? Or maybe any of my classmates have any ideas/stories/suggestions? 

Thank you all in advance, have a lovely weekend!

Hi Prof and everyone,

I was looking through the RepoSense dashboard with all of our iPs, and I noticed that my iP is quite behind (the last commit was on 4th September). However, I have made more commits to my iP since then (including on the same day) but those don't seem to be picked up by RepoSense. I noticed others' commits as new as today are being picked up; is there something I'm doing wrong? Have I perhaps messed up a branch or something?

Can I clarify when we are expected to use the "this" keyword to access member variables in a class? Personally, I prefer to use "this" at all times to be explicit, but I seem to remember being told (either in lecture or in tutorial, can't seem to recall which) not to use it when not required to cut down on clutter. I couldn't find anything on this in the Java coding standard guide. The notes on the website on the use of the "this" keyword don't cover this either. 

I just wanted to confirm if I should always use it or not?

Note that repl.it uses Java version 1.8.0, aka Java 8, NOT Java 11 as we are using for class normally. This may or may not have implications for one of the exercises, due to differences in the String class (eg. Java 11 having some very convenient additions not present in Java 8...)

https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/website/schedule/week3/topics.html#key-exercise-pass-objects-to-move-method

The instructions for creating the move method specifies the following behaviour:

>* Returns null and does nothing if either p or r is null
>* Returns a new Point object that has attributes x and y that match those of r
>* Does not modify p
>* Updates r so that its attributes x and y match those of p

I think the instructions do not make clear whether the returned Point object should have attributes x and y matching those of r before the modification or after. 

The expected output seems to indicate that it is the former; that is, the method returns the previous/initial position of the rectangle as a Point. There's also little point (no pun intended) in directly returning one of the parameters. 

Perhaps the written instructions could be made slightly more explicit in mentioning this?

Hi Prof,

Week 3 Ex2 on repl.it requires us to calculate the area of a rectangle object, by multiplying its height and width together. Is it recommended to use the getter methods for the dimensions of the rectangle, or to just directly access the height and width variables? I noticed the model solution used the latter approach, but I used the getter methods myself. 

The comments in the skeleton code suggest using the setter for changing the dimensions rather than directly modifying the member variables, so I'm wondering why the model solution accessed the member variables directly rather than using the getters. 

Thank you, have a great day!

I hear a lot of my friends having issues with installing Java - specifically, the part about getting it to show up in their PATH as expected - so I thought I'd share what worked for me.

I installed OpenJDK using the AdoptOpenJDK installer, linked [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/). I chose OpenJDK 11 and Hotspot JVM. 

Simply downloading and running the installer should, in theory, configure everything as necessary. By default, the installer will add the JDK to the PATH, so you should not need to perform any additional setup, except configuring your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or whatever you might be using) to use the appropriate JDK. 

Has anyone else had success using this particular installer?

Interesting update: If I use IntelliJ to automatically import each class (i.e. delete my import com.neilbaner.duke.exceptions.* and then Alt-Enter on each exception manually), then by the time I import every single exception (eg. import com.neilbaner.duke.exceptions.TaskIndexOutOfBoundsException, com.neilbaner.duke.exceptions.UnknownCommandException etc. etc, IntelliJ decides that it should combine them all back into com.neilbaner.duke.exceptions.*.

I think prof mentioned in lecture, assertions are for when the programmer causes the error, and exceptions are for when the user or the environment causes the error. The main issue with assertions for errors that can be caused by the user is that ideally they should be disabled for production builds...

In this case, I'd say num can conceivably be null if the user enters, say "omae wa mou shindeiru", so I'm going to go against the grain and say an exception would be the appropriate choice here.

Update: I FIXED IT!!

I've managed to figure out a workaround for this issue, involving getting rid of the dos2unix command entirely. 

How I found this fix:

I tested on my own machine on Ubuntu (with WSL, didn't feel like rebooting multiple times), and I faced the same error with dos2unix. One `sudo apt install dos2unix` later, it worked fine. I suspect dos2unix isn't included on the CI system. 

How I fixed:

First, I removed the lines 

```sh
cp EXPECTED.TXT EXPECTED-UNIX.TXT
dos2unix EXPECTED-UNIX.TXT input.txt
```

Then, I manually created a copy of EXPECTED.TXT and named it EXPECTED-UNIX.txt. (Remember to update the .gitignore to push this file as well!)

Finally, I used the button at the bottom right on IntelliJ

to change the EXPECTED-UNIX.txt to use LF instead of CRLF

et voila!

hi prof pls giv me a plus grade thank u

(NB. This method does require you to update 2 different files every time you need to update your tests, but it's not too bad since you can simply copy and paste it, or you can use dos2unix on your own machine to do it for you even though copy and paste and changing the format is probably fewer keystrokes/clicks)

I see what you mean. How would you suggest I do this for exceptions though? java.lang.Exception, for example, includes a printStackTrace method which means the exception, not the UI class is responsible for printing error messages. For my ip I (not knowing better until much too late) used a static messages class and called it's methods everywhere I needed to print something, including in my DukeException.printErrorMessage().

I'm actually not calling `System.err` directly, I'm using `Exception.printStackTrace()` which prints to `System.err`.

I tried printing my own error message with `System.err.println()` and observed the same result. 

For now I'm just using the workaround above with setting `System.err` to `System.out` and setting it back to normal once I'm done. Not the most elegant workaround ever, but I'm sure you'll agree it beats using `sleep()` :P

The responseSense does not detect branch unless it has been merged to master and pushed to the remote. You just merge your level-five one hour ago and I think you can check the progress tomorrow. 

And similar for the tags, it might be that your tag for the levels does not point to commits in the main branch. Try checking if all the commits of the relevant tags can be found on your main branch. Tag the merging commits, instead of the branch commit.

class A() {

        } catch (SpecialException e) {} // Method 2 - catch Exception thrown
    }
}
```

If we want to prevent `A.a` from being initialised as `null`, should I

1. `assert` within the constructor (Method 1)?
1. catch `Exception` while initialising (Method 2)?
1. `assert` before initialising (Method 3)?

The use of assertions and exceptions depends whether the input is from the user or the programmer, so if it's parsed properly would it be considered from the user or the programmer after parsing?

> I think if you want `num` to be never `null` at any point of the code then method 3 makes sense

If you made a User Guide with tables, you might be wondering why the formatting for the tables works in GitHub but breaks in GitHub pages. Following the advice at this link - https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman/issues/82 - you just need to change the `_config.yml` file to render with `GFM` (GitHub Flavored Markdown). [More details found here.](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-a-markdown-processor-for-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll)

As for adding emojis  like seen at [this link](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md) to your GitHub pages, there is an extra step explained at [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/emoji-on-github-pages) for the change needed in the `_config.yml` file.

For example, if you were using the Cayman theme, you could do something like this:
``` yml
theme: jekyll-theme-cayman
markdown: GFM
plugins:
  - jemoji
```

The `_config.yml` file should be automatically created in the `docs` folder and committed when you choose a theme for your User Guide, but you'll have to add the extra stuff yourself.

Also, here's a use of the emoji and table combination - nice informational boxes:

OS: Windows 10
Increment: [`A-TextUiTesting`](https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/website/schedule/week4/project.html#a-textuitesting)
File: `runtest.bat`

While working on the increment, I find an issue when using file compare (`FC`) for the special characters `âœ“` and `âœ˜`. In the output file `ACTUAL.TXT`, the corresponding characters seem to get converted to `?` (question mark), and the follow lines will be shown in the diff:
```
Comparing files ACTUAL.TXT and EXPECTED.TXT
***** ACTUAL.TXT
 Got it. I've added this task:
  [D][?] do homework (by: no idea)

 Got it. I've added this task:

------------------------------------------------------------
***** EXPECTED.TXT
 Nice! I've marked this task as done:
 [T][Î“Â£Ã´] read book
------------------------------------------------------------
*****
```
To fix it, I basically had to change the the expected character to be a `?` in `EXPECTED.TXT` and it will give me that no differences were encountered. However, this would mean that the test cannot check for `âœ“` and `âœ˜` characters being different.

I guess that the error probably comes from the special characters being unicode characters which is an issue if `FC` isn't expecting it. From the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/fc), there is an option for unicode, but it will be on the whole file and not just a single character.

I also note that in [Updating test as the program evolves](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/textUiTesting.html#updating-tests-as-the-program-evolves), "we accept that the actual behavior should be the new expected behavior".

```Java
import java.util.*;

public class Task {
    public static final String descriptionPrefix = "description: ";
    private String description;
    private boolean important;
    List<String> pastDescription = new ArrayList<>(); // a list of past descriptions

    public Task(String d) {
      this.description = d;

     */
    public void printingDescription(){ System.out.println(this); }

    @Override
    public String toString() { return descriptionPrefix + description; }
}
```
Other than the given ones regarding `descriptionPrefix`, `printingDescription()`, and `important`, these should be the other ones:

- `import java.util.*` should be `import java.util.ArrayList` to be explicit
- `pastDescription` should be `pastDescriptions` to indicate collection
- `this.description = d` can just be `description = d` to reduce noise
- `if` statement should be in wrapped in brackets 
- `getAsXML()` should be `getAsXml()` - lowercase

Did I miss anything?

If we were to take https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html#architecture as an example, then the navigability shows that `Ui` should be the one aware of the `Logic` and `Model` of the application instead of the other way round. I haven't implemented this, but if I were to guess, you could initialise the `Ui` in the main app class and check the other 2 components in the `while` loop.

Let me see if I can try to illustrate. Suppose we have a `Command` class.

```Java
public class Duke {
    /** Instances of class objects for UI. **/
    private final Ui ui;
    private final Parser parser;

    private Duke() {
        ui = new Ui();
        parser = new Parser();
    }

    public void run() {
        boolean isExit = false;
        while (!isExit) {
            String line = ui.readLine();
            Command c = parser.parse(line);
            c.execute();
            isExit = c.isExit();
            ui.printCommand(c); // here, we could try have the Command c as input to the Ui instance
        }
    }

    /**
     * Main entry-point for the java.duke.Duke application.
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Duke().run();
    }
}
```

Maybe the `Command` class might have an overridden `toString()` method? This leaves the `Logic` not having to deal with `Ui` as well.

Not necessarily. If you have proper abstraction within the `Parser` class, a new command could simply use an existing method to prepare the arguments. If your `Parser`, `Command`, `Messages` don't need to be aware of `Ui` as discussed in #88, then a new command would just be a new `Command` subclass, with `Messages` being associated with the `Command`.

In this particular example, I agree with you. There shouldn't be any case where a `Notebook` is printing a `title` of another `Notebook`; that other `Notebook` should call its own method, especially since the methods in question are `private`, not `public`. Perhaps if you are talking about `public` methods using method 1 could be better.

Hey, i think perhaps this will work:

`java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath ..\bin main\java\Duke &gt; input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT`

It seems that because your compilation destination is &gt;root>\bin but the package main.java was compiled and not the files, the classpath is ..\bin but you need to execute the `&gt;package>.&gt;subpackage>.&gt;main class>`.

I personally feel using explicit imports is still better; on top of the stated benefits, I feel it is also more flexible in that it allows you to more clearly and easily remove particular import statements in the event you reorganize your packages and/or the code in the class to which you are importing the packages/classes to.

Honestly think this should be perfectly sound and acceptable, although it isn't exactly specified in most places I've looked (including all the [reference links at the bottom of the SE-EDU Java coding standard page](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/basic.html#references)). 

The alternative to indexing your array would be to write something like `int nameIndex = 0; int dateIndex = 1` which for a 2-element array feels like it actually makes the code a little less readable.

A _possibly_ relevant section I found is in [this doc](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf) under section 10.3, but no explicit mention of array indexing.

Agree this is not so clear cut, so would also like to see what the general recommendation is.

from your commit history it seems you created the `branch-A-Packages` branch from `branch-Level-5`, but i think we are supposed to merge `branch-Level-5` into `master`, `git checkout master`, then `git branch branch-A-Packages` or `git checkout -b branch-A-Packages` from `master`.

As for **multiline code blocks** within markdown tables, can try:

`&gt;pre>&gt;code>list&gt;br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ____________________________________________________________&gt;br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the tasks in your list:&gt;br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.[D][âœ“] test (by: Sep 24 2020 11:59 PM)&gt;br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;____________________________________________________________&gt;/code>&gt;/pre>`

**Note: `&nbsp;`s can be replaced with normal spaces ` `.

which renders to (if used in a table cell)

| column1 | column2 
| ---------|----------
| &gt;pre>list&gt;br>    ____________________________________________________________&gt;br>    Here are the tasks in your list:&gt;br>    1.[D][âœ“] test (by: Sep 24 2020 11:59 PM)&gt;br>    ____________________________________________________________&gt;/pre>

For some reasoning about the above code, 
- [`&gt;pre>` tags displays the text in a fixed-width font, and the text preserves both spaces and line breaks.](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_pre.asp)
- `&gt;code>` tags are needed here to inject the code block, and also so we can use HTML elements like `&gt;br>` within
- `&nbsp;` is a space that cannot be broken by word wrap, but here it should be ok to replace it with normal spaces since `&gt;pre>&gt;/pre>` should handle this
- `&gt;br>` are placed wherever a line break is needed

It's not specified so I personally assumed it's up to the individual's discretion: my tp mate implemented error-checking to only allow the strict date formatting but I personally coded it such that if you get the right format (i.e. YYYYMMDD) the program converts it, otherwise it just uses whatever the user entered (e.g. in 10min).

I haven't used this library at all myself, chanced upon it while reading about monads in Java, but perhaps you could use [`CompletableFuture`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html#runAsync-java.lang.Runnable-java.util.concurrent.Executor-) and use the [`thenRun()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html#thenRun-java.lang.Runnable-) method?

EDIT: I just read the method description more closely and it says that `action` is the process to be performed *before* completing the returned `CompletionStage`, so perhaps it doesn't work as I thought; although there might be another method, or use case for this method, that you could perhaps somehow get to work

Regarding the team project, there are several questions:
1. What should we do if we have implemented the previous commits wrongly into the team repository? (i.e: commits done before the lecture) 
2. If we realised that we have committed too much for the current week/iteration and cannot commit more for the subsequent one, are we allowed to `git --reset` to the older version?

When implementing the JAR file, I encounter the FileNotFoundException. When I tried on the normal java terminal everything works, with or without the duke.txt. Is this something we need to fix or is this ok? My code is as follows:
```
public static final String filepath = "./data/duke.txt";//file path from root file
private static void handlePastData() {
        File pastFile = new File(filepath); // create a File for the given file path
        String wholeDoc = readFile(pastFile);
        //when file is empty or not created
        if (wholeDoc == null) {
            return;//skip parsing data
        }
        //convert file entry to tasks
        parseFile(wholeDoc);
    }
```
This is the error:

I try changing it to:
```
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath ..\bin main\java\Duke < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT
```
The same error still comes out. However, when I change it to:
```
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath ../bin main/java/Duke < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT
```
It works :D. I then try to change all backslash to slash in the runtime.bat file and it also works. I am not really sure why this works, but could this lead to a problem in the future?

javac  -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\*.java

Hi! Sorry, may I know where did your get this error message? Was it via email? Because I actually didn't push my manifest files to my repo but when I checked, it seems to be included in my JAR file (?). So I'm worried that I might have the same error but don't know where to check to see if my JAR passed the smoke test.  Also, do I need to push my manifest.mf file? If so, do I have to resubmit my JAR file again? Thank you!

Personally, I would use method 1 because if it was an invalid input from the user I would assume that the parser/main class caught the error as an exception perhaps while parsing. Therefore, if class A was initialised with null it would be a programmer error. For example, in my tp I actually worked on a person class and the age of a person cannot be &gt; 0 and I used assertion in my constructor rather than an exception because I assumed that the parser class would have caught the error as an exception. However, I am not sure if I'm right either...

Regarding method 3, I think it can still be used, however, I would still prefer method 1 because I am assuming that having num == null in main is fine but num == null in Class A is not.

I think this is a very valid concern and my team has also faced this issue with many merge conflicts over the Ui class.

As I was considering whether I should throw/catch an exception for this, I wondered how would I handle this exception. I will most likely need to print an error message to the user. But I don't see any good way of letting the user know what went wrong, and how to correct it in this situation, since this is almost certainly a problem with the code itself. So, I don't think using an exception is useful. 

I would prefer Method 1 so that this assertion is always made. If I do Method 3 I may forget to assert when doing `new A(num)` somewhere else.

Oh but I guess `num` will be `null` when there is a `NumberFormatException` so I think Method 2 could just be done in the `catch` clause for that?

My code is printing exactly the same thing (a same string consisting of ansi escape codes) without the use of user input, so there shouldnt be a difference. Also, I cannot reproduce the error on my pc (always no difference) and I have no idea of what I could do to reproduce it.

Thanks for the clarification. But a very large chunk of my code was commited on 26 Sept. In this case can I use @@author to mark them as mine? (I am aware that they are commited before 26 Sept so they technically are not counted, but they are functional codes that makes up for the backbone of our program. In fact a large portion of my initial commit has not been modified and are still being used now in multiple critical functionalities.)

Hi, can I ask why IntelliJ treats some of my methods used in other classes as unused? I ctrl-click the method and it says no usage found, but if I ctrl-click the method in where I actually use it, it will refer back to the greyed out method.  My classes are also in grey color while I actually have used them.

I think there is no need for assertions or exceptions to check if num is null. Since int is a primitive type and not an object, the programmer will get a compile time error if they happen to do `int num = null`. All primitive types have a default value, so if the parsing of user input into an integer fails, we can assume that num will be initialized into 0.

However if you are asking for other object types, my answer would be method 1. Because it lets the programmer know that the program had tried to initialize with a null value. Prompting the programmer to look for instances of where this was called.

Hi, I was unable to complete all the steps during the lecture for the circus activity, so I attempted them again. However, I made the mistake of deleting my previous forked repository on Github as I thought it was interfering with my unsuccessful pushes. Currently, the main branch has been updated and hence I was unable to make another branch called "in-lecture". May I know how I should go about solving this issue?

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: Question regarding traditional task method for Level-4**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2021S1/forum/issues/32" expanded>

Hi,
I was wondering whether we are supposed to retain the traditional task entry feature (e.g. type anything, added as task) as we code Level-4. This seems redundant since the old task method seems to be identical to "ToDo" tasks now.

Also, may I ask how strictly should we stick to the example outputs? It seems possible to detect the types of tasks automatically by looking for the "by" and "at" keywords in the string itself, but I'm not sure if such implementation/deviation from example output is allowed. (This method will follow the input of Level-2/Level-3)

Thanks for any advice regarding these queries.

@okkhoy Thanks for the clarification. 

Regarding the second part, I meant to write the program such that it automatically categorizes the type of task by detecting "/at" and "/by" (or the lack thereof) on the input so that the user does not need to enter specifically the type of task(e.g. typing `project meeting /at Mon 2-4pm` instead of  `event project meeting /at Mon 2-4pm`). However, since the Level-2 commands are retained, I am uncertain of how the automated categorization can distinguish (or is required to distinguish) between a Level-2 "task" and To-Do since they seem like the same thing. Is it a better idea to stick with the guidelines provided by the sample output?

@daniellimws  @okkhoy 
Apologies for the delayed reply. I just realized my issue is the result of my blunder of forking @okkhoy 's Circus fork instead of the one at `https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2021S1/circus`. I have since re-done the activity with the correct fork and everything seems to work now.

Appreciate the help provided.

@okkhoy 
I was mistaken that the `https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2021S1/circus` project (I probably shouldn't have called that the 'main branch') had been updated with an `in-lecture` branch when in actual fact I accidentally forked your fork instead. Apologies for the inconvenience caused.

Hi,

I don't really understand about why the example code for the increment A-MoreOOP initialises instances of classes instead of just using static methods.

For example, it initialises a instance `ui` of class `Ui` to print things, but couldn't we achieve the functionality of printing things with static methods?

Would like to know if there's any benefits of using instances of classes instead of static methods in these cases that I'm missing.

> I think in terms of member functions: if a method do not invoke any non-static variables, the method should be static.

I also thought this way, that's why I was a bit confused why the example code used non-static methods even though I don't see how the methods for those classes could invoke non-static variables.

Hi, I was merging branch-Level-6 to master branch but did not check the "Create a new commit even if fast forward is possible". It resulted in something like this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37478363/93120936-ad69c800-f6f6-11ea-89be-e2a3dfa6ee6e.png)

Then I did a **git reset --keep branch-Level-6@{1}** but was unable to revert back to the previous state before merging as the branch-Level-6 returned to the 2nd last commit in branch-Level-6 and master stayed at my last commit of branch-Level-6. So I merged master back into branch-Level-6 which went back into the situation shown in the picture above.  I was unable to revert the merge after that.

How do I move master back to origin/master? Would it be safe to checkout origin/master and reset master branch there? Or may I know if there is any other solution to this?

Hi prof, I have a function that requries the printing of unicode characters and could not find an alternative in a short period of time. Would it be considered too much to ask if I required the user to enter `chcp 65001` in the UG before actually starting the app or should I manually call the command using in the java code?

@Chongjx I did some research and I think the issue is the windows command terminal (cmd) just does not enable ANSI escape codes by default. As such I think the only way to get coloured outputs in windows cmd would be to get the user to enable it on their terminal window, or ask them to use powershell instead

On using the print option in the chrome browser to obtain a PDF of the tp UG or DG (jekyll theme: Minima):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57522870/98079234-6c985f00-1eae-11eb-8d12-f3a4948d9b3c.png)

The PDF is rendered, however, at page breaks it looks something like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57522870/98079452-c39e3400-1eae-11eb-8558-4c68b6af06fa.png)

Sometimes, even the titles are split at page breaks. I have tried the following things:
(some involving CSS which I'm not very proficient in, so I'm probably doing something wrong)

* Played with the settings in the print mode and seeing whether anything changes. (A trivial thing, most definitely didn't help)
* One thing I did was try and render the web page after changing some settings in the developer tools:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57522870/98079794-5fc83b00-1eaf-11eb-8ada-1b9d93574b78.png)

Selecting the "print" style under rendering:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57522870/98079889-8dad7f80-1eaf-11eb-9cd2-1ec0b55d3878.png)
 However, this was to no avail :(

* Another thing is saw a post in stackoverflow recommended changing the CSS style of the theme (?) . So according to [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll#customizing-your-themes-css) one may customise the CSS of a jekyll theme in the following manner:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57522870/98080756-e5001f80-1eb0-11eb-9f39-32750398fa31.png)

So I created style.css in assets and populated it with the following (+ the import statement from the instructions):

``` css
@media print {
    div, image, svg {
        break-inside: avoid;
    }
```

However, still can't seem to print without splitting images and text at page breaks. I think this will be considered as a UG/DG bug if the pdf is like this.. 

I speculate I'm doing something wrong with CSS **OR** that I might have to go through the process of installing Bundler and then the Ruby Gems to set up the webpage with jekyll and then be able to add to the existing CSS files.  However, still not quite sure.

It would be great to get some help on this issue ^_^" 

Thank you in advance!

I faced the same issue and after implementing @wangqinNick solution, the terminal will still show ```Î“Â£Ã¿``` and ```Î“Â£Ã´``` instead of ```âœ˜``` and ```âœ“``` when I have yet to change the ```EXPECTED.txt``` to match ```ACTUAL.txt```. But when I open ```ACTUAL.txt``` it shows ```âœ˜``` and ```âœ“``` correctly. 
After I changed ```EXPECTED.txt``` to match ```ACTUAL.txt```, no differences will be detected when I run runtest.bat so I believe it is the terminal that is not able to show the correct symbol rather than java.

I think the link to the example ppp on https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/website/admin/tp-deliverables.html#deliverable-project-portfolio-page-ppp is broken.

Is this the link that's supposed to be referenced: https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/team/johndoe.html ?

An automated smoke testing of your iP JAR file found the application crashes with the following error(s) upon launching:
On Windows, using Java 11, for the ip.jar uploaded on 10-02-2020 (DD-MM-YYYY) at 04:22:13:
Error: Invalid or corrupt jarfile ip.jar

Anyone know what causes this errors? I tried running this jar file on my windows and it works. I asked my friends using MAC and Windows to try running the jar file and all of them said that they can run it.

It has been frequently suggested during the course that output be extracted out to Ui and messages class and parsing functionalities be extracted to Parser class. 

Doesn't this approach mean for every command added, we need to change Ui, Parser, Command, Messages and object classes extensively? Does this indicate high coupling? As most of our development are adding commands over time, are we changing too many classes every time we do that?

Would a better approach be to put most of the logic for every command in Command classes? Then, adding a command would mostly require changes only to that specific command class. Other teammates can work on other commands with lesser conflicts.

This is something new to me too as I thought the code that you have written for your constant is fine. I tried what you did and the check gave me the same warning. However, when I added 'static' before 'final' the check passed. So, I believe that constants should have the 'static' keyword in it and hence the check only passes such cases. 
Also, if you try to refactor something in your code into a constant, the IDE will automatically declare it with the 'static' key word in it, like so:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49060098/95012506-b56cb600-066b-11eb-9cf0-fc38bbf5f438.png)

Below are some useful information I found about what static does and I hope this might explain why we need 'static' when declaring our constants.

Maybe you can try the following? So instead of using `Duke`, it's `duke.Duke` instead, based on the structure inside the bin folder:
`java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath ..\bin duke.Duke &gt; input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT`
